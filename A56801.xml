         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> hath now bleſſed experience what that <hi>participated <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs</hi> is, (if we may ſo Call it) which glorified Souls have in the <hi>Divine preſence,</hi> by having <hi>Communion</hi> with God, the firſt
<hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Being.</hi> Whilſt he lived here on Earth, he ſaw many
<hi>Changes</hi> paſſing over himſelf, both as to his Perſon and Condition; this put him upon the Contemplation of the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs</hi> of God, and cauſed him to ſeek for that
<hi>Reſt</hi> in God which he could not find in himſelf, nor in any thing here below. And as thoſe that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Spirit did clearly perceive that he was much quickned and helped, as to his Spiritual Eſtate, by meditating much of an <hi>Holy Reſt</hi> in God; So it is not to be doubted, if we take the ſame Courſe, and keep the eye of our minds fixed on God, labouring to take up all our Reſt and Satisfaction in him; there ſhall we find that true quiet to our Souls, which we vainly ſeek after in the Variety of Objects here below. And the ſerious peruſing of theſe Diſcourſes, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of the <hi>Impreſs</hi> of the Authors Spirit <pb facs="tcp:60044:4"/>upon them, may be of good uſe to us to help us to attain ſuch an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> had no thoughts at firſt of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth theſe Sermons unto <hi>publick view,</hi> but being much perſwaded hereunto by his <hi>Neareſt Relation;</hi> at laſt he yielded unto that Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and perfected them with his own hand. The reſt of his Notes being left in <hi>Characters,</hi> it is much to be feared, theſe are the laſt Sermons of his that are like to ſee the Light.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe, I may only add this, That it is matter of ſad
<hi>Lamentation</hi> to us, to conſider how many of the Faithful Servants of God, who have been <hi>eminent</hi> in their <hi>Generations,</hi> have been taken away in a few years. Certainly it becomes us to bewail greatly the
<hi>deaths</hi> of ſo many Godly <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and ſince the Harveſt is great, and the faithful Labourers are but few, we ſhould pray the Lord of the Harveſt that he would thruſt forth Labourers into the Vineyard;</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dearly and longed for in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; Grace, Mercy, and Peace unto you from God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the Eternal Spirit.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now many years ſince, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, we have been called to worſhip his great and Reverend Name together; during which time God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een exceeding good to us, manifeſting his Power in our weakneſs, and his Love in our unworthineſs: He hath declared his Name <pb facs="tcp:60044:5"/>to be recorded amongst us, by his coming to us, and bleſſing of us: Some of you have been Convinced, ſome Converted, ſome Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and all (I hope) quickened and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Heavenwards: And not only your ſelves, but, through the Grace of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have been born to Chriſt amongst us, and more built up in the holy Faith. O the many, warm, ſweet and refreſhing Sabbaths we have enjoyed together! And what ſhall we ſay to theſe things, or what ſhall we do? O, let us bow down at the foot of God, and adore his infinitely, infinitely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely free, rich, and powerful Grace, aſcribing all the glory to that alone, to which (I am ſure) all is due. God hath now called me aſide from you, and not only from you, but he ſeems to be calling me out of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, yea, out of this World: I have long had a weak and infirm Body, but now God, in his wiſe and holy Providence, hath ſeen good to reduce me to a far lower and weaker ſtate of Body, my Health being now vtterly broken: Yet I must ſay, God is exceeding good to me, and deals in fatherly tenderneſs <pb facs="tcp:60044:5"/>with me; I have neither much ſickneſs, nor much pain, only my Diſeaſe, according to its name, gradually conſumes me, nor am I without ſome lucid intervals: God both lifts me up, and casts me down, (as he dealt with the Church of old;) Sometimes I am under ſome revivings, which ſeem to give hopes of a return from the Grave; Anon nothing but Death ſeems to be in view; And in this dubious ſtate I am waiting upon the Will of God, which (I am ſure) is Holy, Wiſe, and Good, and which (I hope) ſhall be welcome to me, whether it be for Life or Death: Hitherto, through Grace, Death hath not been terrible to me; what it may be, in its neareſt approaches, I cannot tell; but I look to, and reſt upon him, who hath deſtroyed both Death, and him that had the power of Death.</p>
            <p>And now only two things I beg of you: One is, That you all give me a room in your Prayers, while I am in the Land of the Living; and I deſire you would beg of God theſe things for me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That all ſin and guilt cleaving to <pb facs="tcp:60044:6"/>me may be fully expiated and diſcharged through the Blood of Chriſt. O beg both forgiveneſs and repentence for me, which (God knows) I greatly need.</p>
            <p>Secondly That my Will may be throughly reſigned up into the Will of God, either for Life or Death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That I may have much of God's Preſence with me, and may alwaies have good Thoughts of Him and his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards me, in all He doth, or ſhall lay upon me.</p>
            <p>Fourthly That if God ſhall pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me, I may come out of this Furnace pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſied and refined, as Gold that is tryed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, and more fitted for my Maſters Service: or if his pleaſure is, (which ſeems at preſent most probable) to put a period to my mortal life, that his Love, and the Light of his Countenance may ſhine upon me, to ſweeten the bitter pangs of Death to me: we cannot live comfortably without his Love, much leſs can we die comfortably without it. That is my first request: The other is, That you will accept and embrace <pb facs="tcp:60044:6"/>ſome plain, but weighty counſels. God is my Record, that my hearts-deſire and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for you is and has been, that you may be ſaved, and in love to your ſalvation I leave theſe Directions with you.</p>

               <hi>1.</hi> Above all things look well to, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make ſure of an Union with Christ, knowing aſſuredly that without Union with him, all your Religion is vain and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Take heed of too much addictedneſs to his World, as remembring, that if any Man love the World, the Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him; and that the friendſhip of this World is enmity to God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Dwell much within, and be much converſant in Heart-work, in ſtudying the Heart, ſearching the Heart, cleanſing the Heart, keeping the Heart, looking alwaies upon it as the veriest Cheat and Impoſtor in the World, deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Take heed of ſplitting upon that fatal Roek of ſelf-deceit, of which you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard, and upon which the greateſt <pb facs="tcp:60044:7"/>part of Profeſſors ſplit and periſh for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Set up and keep up the Worſhip of God both in your Families and Cloſets: for the Lord's ſake let none of yours be Prayerleſs Families.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6,</hi> Alwaies maintain a great honour and reverence for all God's Ordinances, and in an eſpecial manner honour and ſanctifie his Sabbath: The Sabbath-day is your Souls Market day: O loſe not your Market.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> Be univerſally honest and upright in your Callings, and your Dealings in them; the fraudulent dealings of Profeſſors do much reproach the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8.</hi> Covet to ſeat your ſelves under a ſound, clear, ſearching Goſpel miniſtry, and keep mainly to the ſame Miniſtry; and the Lord guide you therein.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> Labour that your profiting under the Miniſtry may appear unto all men: it will be a dreadful thing to enjoy rich means, and bring forth no fruit to perfection: O Sirs be fruitful Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10.</hi> Expect further Trials and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <pb facs="tcp:60044:7"/>and prepare for them: there is a dark and gloomy Day coming, ſuch as (I am apt to think) you and I have never ſeen any like unto it, and ſuch as wherein (poſſibly) you will think it best with them that God ſhall have hid in the Grave before hand: But be not troubled, it will be ſhort; and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Day will follow, a Day wherein the Church of God ſhall ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Lamb, a Day wherein our dear Lord and Head ſhall reign gloriouſly: And therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11.</hi> Pray and long, long and pray much and earneſtly for the coming of the Day of God, for the coming of Chriſt's Kingdom: Thy Kingdom come, is a Petition ſhould be much upon our hearts. O do not Rest in low things as to divine appearances and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations both in the World and in your own Souls. Theſe Counſels I leave with you out of that entire love and affection I bear to your ſalvation, and our Lord's honour as concerned in you. I will conclude all with

               </argument>
               <p>IT is a great, as well as a true Obſervation, which I have read in a Learned Man; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>all the many various Attributes of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60044:9"/>mentioned in the Scripture, are no other than his very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Here is a Diſplay or Repreſentation of God in one Ray or Beam of his Divine Glory, and that is his Unchangeableneſs, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not;</hi> or, I the Lord am not changed: for it may be read either Actively or Paſſively, and the ſenſe will be the ſame: <hi>I change not,</hi> I am not alter'd or varied at all, what I was, I am; what I am, I ſtill ſhall be:<note place="margin">Deus hic ſe tacitè mortalibus opponit et a ſe. Procul repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit omnem incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam.
<hi>Calv.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God here</hi> (as a judicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor obſerves) <hi>tacitly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to mortal men, and removes and renounces all wavering and inconſtancy from himſelf. I change not;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Men die, but I live; men change, but I change not, I am ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is a Mention or Declaration of the bleſſed Fruit or Iſſue of this Glorious Perfection of God, in reference to his Church and People, and that is their preſervation from deſtruction:
<hi>Therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> Here two things muſt be enquired into; Firſt, Who are we to underſtand by the Sons of Jacob? And, ſecondly, What by their being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who are we to underſtand by the Sons of
<hi>Jacob?</hi> By the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> here we are to <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60044:10"/>underſtand God's Profeſſing Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We read in Scripture of <hi>the Houſe of Jacob, the Seed of Jacob, and the Sons of Jacob;</hi> by all which are meant, God's Church and People, whom he takes into Covenant with himſelf, and makes the Objects of his Love; and this will be evident, by comparing my Text with <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.2. where God ſayes expreſly, that <hi>he loved them;</hi> And again, <hi>I loved Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What are we to underſtand by their being not conſumed? It imports and carries in it theſe two things;
<list>
                     <item>1. An Exemption from Temporal Ruine.</item>
                     <item>2. A Preſervation from Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An Exemption from Temporal Ruine: <hi>Therefore ye are not conſumed:</hi> that is, therefore you are not cut off from being a People; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are not utterly broken by my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; 'tis true, ſome afflictions you have had, yea great afflictions; but yet ſtill you live, ſtill you are a People, you are preſerved from utter ruine and deſtruction. And why ſo? Not becauſe you have not deſerved to be utterly cut off and deſtroyed, but becauſe I am unchangeable; <hi>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60044:10"/>
               <p n="2">2. A Preſervation from Eternal Deſtruction;
<hi>Therefore ye are not conſumed;</hi> that is, therefore you are not in Hell, therefore you are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eternal Revelations of my Wrath, which (alas!) is what you have deſerved: As if God ſhould ſay to them, True, you have had affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but (alas!) it has been nothing to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of your ſin, your ſins have been many and great againſt me, ſuch as deſerved utter ruine, yea eternal deſtruction, an utter Conſumption both of Body and Soul for ever; and this had been your portion long ſince, had you not had to deal with an unchangeable God; not your deſert, but my unchangeableneſs is the ſole cauſe why you are not utterly and eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the deſign of the whole was to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them with their ſins, and particularly their ingratitude; and withall, to let them know, that the reaſon why it was not worſe with them than it was, yea, why they were not totally and eternally deſtroyed, was not becauſe they did not deſerve to have had it ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their God was unchangeable: <hi>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore, &amp;c.</hi> In which God ſeems thus to beſpeak them: You complain of me, and have hard thoughts of me, becauſe
'tis with you as it is, and I do not preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe for your help; but let me tell you, 'tis well for you, that 'tis not ten thouſand times worſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60044:11"/>with you than it is; 'tis well you are a People; 'tis well you are not among the Damned; Sure I am, <hi>you highly</hi> deſerv'd to have had it ſo with <hi>you;</hi> you are a ſinful, ſinning, rebellious people, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have deſerved to be deſtroyed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over; I have done great things for you above any people, I have ſhewn you much love, but you have not walked ſutably and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to the great things I have done for you, nor the great love I have ſhewn to you: No, you have abuſed all, and ſinned againſt me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all, and that with an high hand, whereby you have deſerved to be utterly conſumed and deſtroyed; and indeed, had I not been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God, conſumed and deſtroyed you had been long agoe; I ſee that in you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, for which I might juſtly deſtroy you, and that for ever, and nothing but my own Unchangeableneſs keeps you alive; Should you therefore complain of me? Should you not rather admire at my patience and forbearance ſo long with you, and towards you? Truly 'tis a Miracle of Grace, Goodneſs, and Patience in me, that you have not been long ſince deſtroyed once for all. This I take to be the true ſcope and meaning of the Word; the ſum of which, together with the foundation of my intended Diſcourſe from them, I ſhall give you in this ſhort Poſition; Namely, <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60044:11"/>
                  <q>That the Lord Jehovah is an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God; or how changeable ſoever the Creatures are, yet God the Lord changes not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whoever changes, I the Lord change not, I am alwayes and for ever the ſame. Now that God is unchangeable, wherein he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, why, or whence 'tis that he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as alſo the vindication of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs from all Cavils and Objections that ſeem to lye againſt it, with the practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all, are the principal matters that will fall under conſideration in the proſecution of this Argument; and I hope, by the aſſiſtance of God, we ſhall find ſome light, and much comfort and quickening in our going through them.</p>

                  <hi>By which</hi> (as a learned Man obſerves) <hi>is noted to us, the Majeſty, Holineſs, and perfect Bleſſedneſs of God;</hi> and here he is called the <hi>Father of Lights.</hi> To note that all Light, all Glory, all Holineſs and Bleſſedneſs is originally in him, and that whatever of theſe Creatures do partake of, does come from him as its proper Spring <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60044:12"/>and Fountain.

<hi>Jehovah,</hi> which here God gives himſelf, <hi>I am Jehovah, I change not,</hi> q. d.

<hi>Thou art the ſame,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to God; or, which is more ſutable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> Thou art thy ſelf, alwayes thy ſelf. Thus God is unchangeable in his Being or Eſſence; and when I ſay he is unchangeable in his Being or Eſſence, I ſay he is unchangeable in all his Eſſential Properties, his Wiſdom, his Power, his Juſtice, his Holineſs, his Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his All-ſufficiency, and the like.

               <p n="2">2.

He is Bleſſed, and that not onely Objectively, as he is the great Object of the Praiſes, Bleſſings, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirings of Men and Angels for ever; nor yet as he is the Spring and Fountain of all that <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60044:16"/>bleſſedneſs which the one and the other of them do eternally enjoy; but Subjectively, being a God infinitely bleſſed and happy: God is the moſt happy and bleſſed Being, he is ſo bleſſed, that 'tis more then all the Creatures, whether Men or Angels, can do to add the leaſt tittle or <hi>iota</hi> to his bleſſedneſs: Hence we read, That <hi>their goodneſs extendeth not to him,</hi> Pſal. 16.2. And again, <hi>Can a Man be profitable unto God? And is it gain to him that thou makeſt thy wayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</hi> That is, 'Tis no profit, no gain to God, no addition to his happineſs or perfection, that we, or any, are or do ſo.

7, 8. <hi>If thou be righteous, What giveſt thou unto him? Or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a Man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the Son of Man, but not God:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God is never the more happy or unhappy by any thing the Creature does or can do: 'Tis ture, the Saints and Angels both do love him, praiſe him, admire and adore him for ever; they caſt all their Crowns down at his Foot: But alas! this adds not one <hi>iota</hi> to his happineſs; No,
<hi>He is exalted above all Bleſſing and Praiſe,</hi> Nehem. 9.5. Yea,
'tis a ſtopping, a condeſcenſion in him to take notice of theſe things, as you have it <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.5, 6. And indeed, 'tis our happineſs, not God's, to love him, ſerve him, praiſe him, walk with him, and live to him.

<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10. <hi>This is as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Noah unto me; for as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the Earth, ſo have I ſworn, that I will no more be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee: For the Mountains ſhall <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60044:21"/>depart, and the Hills be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my Peace be removed, ſaith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.</hi> Pray obſerve, God had in the two foregoing verſes promiſed his Church and People, that, <hi>though for a ſmall moment he had forſaken them, yet with great Mercies he would gather them; and that though in a little wrath he had hid his face from them for a moment, yet with Everlaſting kindneſs he would have mercy on them,</hi> and here in theſe two verſes, he gives them a double ground of the aſſurance hereof; the one taken from his Oath, and the unchangeableneſs thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the other from his Covenant, and the unchangeableneſs thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>For the Mountains ſhall depart, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The Mountains and Hills may ſooner be removed than my Covenant; yea, the time will come when theſe ſhall be removed, but the time will never come that my Covenant ſhall fail or be removed.

               <p n="6">6. God is unchangeable in his Grace and Love to his People.

They are indeed <hi>the dearly beloved of his ſoul,</hi> as you have it <hi>Jer.</hi>
12.7. and in this Love of his towards them, he is unchangeable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame, which I ſhall at once a little open, and evince unto you in three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is unchangeable in his Love it ſelf to his People, that being alwayes the ſame towards them; <hi>I have loved thee</hi> (ſayes God to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>with an Everlaſting Love, Jer.</hi> 31.3. with <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60044:23"/>a Love that is from everlaſting to everlaſting, without change or period; God's Love to his People is ſo firm and ſtable, that nothing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can poſſibly null or alter it, nothing can poſſibly caſt them out of his heart; if any thing could do it, it would be their ſinnings againſt him, and their breakings with him; but theſe do not, cannot do it, ſo he has told us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33. If they ſin, I'le correct them for their ſin; <hi>but my loveing-kindneſs I will not take from them;</hi> or, (as ſome render it) I will not ſo much as interrupt my Love towards them; as if he ſhould ſay, though they ſin, yet I'le love them ſtill: God does not love the ſins of his People, no, he hates them, but he loves their perſons notwithſtanding their ſins: But what if afflictions and temptations be added to their ſins, and both the one and the other riſe high, will not this break off his Love from them? No, ſee that triumph of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. <hi>ult. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of God? ſhall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs or Perſecution, and the like?

                  </note> 
                  <hi>God hath loved from eternity, and he will love to eternity.</hi> The truth is, could either ſins or ſufferings caſt us out of God's Heart, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from his Love; who then among the Saints could hope to continue in his Love, and upon his Heart? Beſides, in the place lately quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9.10. God ſayes expreſly, that though the Mountains ſhould be removed, yet his kindneſs to his People ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; no, that remains firm and ſtedfaſt for ever. True, God may poſſibly afflict his People, and that many wayes, and very ſorely; he may ſpeak againſt them as againſt <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi>
31.20. write againſt them, and that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, as againſt <hi>Job, Job.</hi> 13.26. He may fight againſt them, as againſt thoſe,

               <p n="2">2. God is unchangeable in all the ſpecial ſaving Fruits and Effects of his Love to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>the Gifts and Calling of God <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60044:24"/>are without repentance;</hi> that is, the Gifts of his effectual Calling, or his ſaving Gifts, ſuch as effectual Calling, and the like, ſhall never be repented of, never be recalled or reverſed by him; as they who receive thoſe Gifts will have no cauſe to repent, but to rejoice in them for ever; ſo God who gives them, will not repent that he gave them to them. God gives Chriſt, he gives Grace, he gives Peace, he gives Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he gives Righteouſneſs, he gives Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gives eternal Life to his People, and all out of his love to them; and he never recalls or reverſes theſe Fruits and Effects of Love.

Soul! Hath God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of his ſaving Gifts upon thee? then they are thine for ever: Has he given thee his Chriſt? he will never repent of it, never call him back again, but ſweet Jeſus is thine for ever: Has he given thee his Spirit? He will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, nor will he ever recall this bleſſed Gift from thee; the holy, good, and glorious Spirit is thine for ever: Has he given thee a new and ſpiritual Life? Has he given thee Grace, Pardon, Righteouſneſs, Juſtification, and the like? He will never repent of it; all theſe are <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60044:25"/>thine for ever: O how ſweet is this to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate! thou mayeſt ſit down, and ſay, Chriſt is mine, the Comforter is mine, Life, Peace, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Righteouſneſs, Salvation are all mine, and that for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is unchangeable in the real deſigns and workings of his Love; I ſay, real, though not ſenſible; God's Love to his People may be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and interrupted, as to the ſenſible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and manifeſtations thereof, but yet even then 'tis active, and really at work for them, however the outward diſpenſation may vary; now ſmile, then frown; now lift up, then caſt down; now fill, then empty; now form light, then create darkneſs; yet in all ſtill he goes on in one even conſtant tenure of love towards them; in all, his love is at work for them and towards them, and he intends and deſigns them as much love in one as in the other, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly firſt or laſt effects and accompliſhes it: and this is but agreeable to his Covenant with them and promiſe to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.
<hi>I'le make</hi> (ſayes he to his People) <hi>an Everlaſting Covenant with you, never to turn away from you to do you good.</hi> And, <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that Love God, Rom.</hi> 8.28. Whatever God does with us, however he ſeems to carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, yet ſtil he is doing us good, and acting his love towards us; <hi>We</hi> (as an Holy Man ſpeaks) <hi>are apt to think that God ſhews us love, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60044:26"/>when he doth ſome great thing for us; but</hi> (faith he) <hi>God is alwayes acting out his Love towards us, when he frowns, as well as when he ſmiles; when he withdraws, as well as when he approaches to us:</hi> In a word, Soul! whatever God does, there is love in it, and he deſigns thee love and good by it: Does he ſmile, give, fill, keep alive, draw near to thee? In all there is love, his ſpecial love works and runs through all; or, does he frown, take, empty, kill, hide his face? In all this there is love, yea, the the ſame ſpecial love of his, works in all, and runs through all; God is acting out his Love to thee in the one as well as in the other. O how ſweet is this! Death to the People of God, comes from the ſame Fountain of Love in God's heart that Life does.</p>

All change, my Beloved, argues imperfection in the ſubject changed: for, pray obſerve, there is a two-fold change, there is a corruptive, and there is a perfective change; a corruptive change is a change from good to bad, or from bad to worſe, and ſuch a change to be ſure argues imperfection in the ſubject; a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive change, is a change from bad to good, or from good to better, and this alſo argues imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Subject, this argues the Subject to be imperfect before, whatever 'tis now: Thus all change neceſſarily argues imperfection; but God is infinitely perfect, and therefore not ſubject to change; he is capable of no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, nor yet a perfective change; becauſe he is an infinitely perfect Being, and ſo can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing added to him, nothing taken from him: <hi>Be ye perfect</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>as your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect, Mat.</hi> 5.48. Our Heavenly Father is a perfect Being, he is both eſſentially and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally perfect; he is perfect in himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all excellencies and perfections centring in him; and he is the ſpring and cauſe of all thoſe <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60044:28"/>excellencies and perfections that are found in the Creatures: <hi>God is light,</hi> (ſayes Saint <hi>John</hi>) <hi>and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1
<hi>Job.</hi> 1.5. that is, he is both pure and perfect; pure without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and perfect without defect; he is wholly perfection, and therefore unchangeable. What ſhall I ſay? God is ſo good, ſo full, ſo bleſſed, ſo every way perfect, that 'tis impoſſible he ſhould change. 'Tis a great ſpeech I have read in one of the Ancients; <hi>For thee,</hi>

                  <p> Several Propoſitions laid down for the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Objections, and the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God's Unchangeableneſs from all cavil and contradiction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next Work we have to do, is to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the unchangeableneſs of God from all cavils and contradiction, and to obviate ſuch Objections as may ſeem to lie againſt it, which I ſhall do by making good theſe 4 Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Propoſition is this; That God's repenting, which we ſometimes read of in Scripture, is no way inconſiſtent with, or repugnant to the Truth and Glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs. Oftentimes, in Scripture, God is ſaid to repent, and he is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent both of what he has done, and alſo of what he hath ſaid he would do. Firſt, He is ſaid to repent of ſome things he had done. So he is ſaid <hi>to repent that ever he made Man, Gen.</hi> 6.6.
<hi>It repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth; and it grieved him at his heart. So it repented him that he had made Saul King,</hi> 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. <hi>It repenteth me</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>that I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60044:30"/>have ſet up Saul to be King.</hi> Secondly, God is ſaid to repent of ſome things which he hath ſaid he would do. So
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.14. <hi>The Lord will repent him concerning his ſenvants.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.19. <hi>The Lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced againſt them;</hi> with many other places which might be mentioned: Thus God is ſaid to repent both wayes. Now repentance imports a change; and how then is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable? I Anſwer, Nevertheleſs unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able becauſe of his repenting; for, pray obſerve, when God is ſaid in Scripture to repent, 'tis to be <hi>underſtood</hi> not in a proper, but in an improper and alluſive ſenſe; not <hi>affective,</hi> but <hi>effectivè;</hi> not according to his internal Will, but an external Work: God is therefore ſaid to repent,<note place="margin">Paenitere dicitur mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hominum quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar penitent is voluit diſſipare quod fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Lyra. in</hi> Gen. <hi>6.6.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe he doth as men do, when they repent, that is, he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Deeds, yet without any change of his Will; yea,<note place="margin">Deus panitere dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quando mutat factum.
<hi>Pet. Mar.</hi>
                  </note> the change of his Deeds, is the execution of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Will: When Men repent, they ceaſe to do what they had begun, and they are ready to deſtroy what they had wrought; and thus God is ſaid to repent, not becauſe his mind is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but becauſe he ceaſeth to do what he did, or he deſtroyeth what he had made: thus he is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60044:30"/>ſaid <hi>to repent of his making Saul King,</hi> becauſe he meant to remove him from being King; and <hi>to repent of his making Man,</hi> becauſe he meant to deſtroy Man for his ſin. Now ſuch repenting does not argue the leaſt change in God, and therefore in the very ſame place where he is ſaid thus to repent, he is alſo ſaid not to repent, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. &amp; 29.11. he is ſaid <hi>to repent of making Saul King:</hi> And in <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>that he will not lie, nor repent, nor is he a man that he ſhould repent;</hi> He can no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in a proper ſenſe, as repentance imports change, than he can lie; and when, as there 'tis ſaid of him, that <hi>he is not a Man that he ſhould repent,</hi> There is thus much implyed, That he muſt ceaſe to be God, and become Man, if he ſo repents as to note change in him.
'Tis a good and indeed a great Obſervation which one has upon this place;
<hi>No repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly befal God,</hi>

                  </note>
                  <hi>whereas he is immutable, moſt wiſe, moſt bleſſed; but he is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, when he retracts and revokes his benefits from a Perſon or People.</hi> In a word, he is ſaid to repent, <hi>quoad effectorum mutationem,</hi> as to the change of effects, but <hi>non quoad ſeipſum,</hi> not as to himſelf, in either his Nature or Will: But this will <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60044:31"/>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60044:32"/>appear further in the next Propoſition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Propoſition is this, That the non-execution and accompliſhment of ſome Threats and Promiſes of God, which we find in his Word, is no impeachment of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs. True, there are many things both threatned and promiſed by God in his Word that do never come to paſs; God ſometimes threatens what he does not execute, as in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.1, &amp; 5. compared; and of <hi>Nineveh, Jonah</hi> 3.4. with 10. On the other hand God ſometimes promiſes that which is never accompliſhed, of which inſtances not a few might be given. Now does not this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach and contradict his unchangeableneſs? I anſwer, No; neither the one nor the other of theſe is any way repugnant or contradictory thereunto: for, pray conſider, thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promiſes which are not accompliſht, are not abſolute, but conditional threatnings and promiſes, threatnings and promiſes that have either an expreſs or implicit condition in them, which condition being wanting, the non-accompliſhment of the Threat or Promiſe is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with, that it ſtrongly argues the unchangeableneſs of God. I ſhall illuſtrate this by ſome inſtances, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7,
8, 9, 10. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60044:32"/>and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi> Mark, here is both evil threatned, and good promiſed, but both under a condition; now if the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which the one is threatned, and the other is promiſed, be wanting, let it not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to any change in God, if either the one or the other be not accompliſht: When an evil is threatned, and not executed; and when a good is promiſed, and not performed, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>execution of the one, and the non-performance of the other, is not becauſe God is not unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but becauſe the condition upon which the one was threatned, and the other promiſed, is found wanting. I might argue in like manner from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. <hi>begin. Rev.</hi>
2.22. But let this one ſuffice inſtead of all the reſt. And to this purpoſe ſpeaks a learned Man.<note place="margin">Deus mutatſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ſed non decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>Bradw.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>changes his Sentence,</hi> the outward threatning or promiſe, <hi>but not his Decree,</hi> not his inward Counſel or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And to the ſame effect is the ſaying of <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60044:33"/>another;<note place="margin">Si conſilium Dei ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamus, non poteſt eum poenitere; at ſententiae Dei per pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas ſignificatae ſape mutantur. <hi>Pet. Mar.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>we reſpect the Counſel of God, that he does not, he cannot change, but his Mind and Will revealed by the Prophets, that is often changed.</hi> And 'tis a great ſaying of one of the School-men,<note place="margin">Aliud eſt mutare vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, aliud velle mutationem.
<hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>'Tis one thing</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>for God to change his Will, and another thing to will a change:</hi> God often wills and determines a change, but he never changes his Will or Determination; thus where an evil is threatned, or a good promiſed, which is not accompliſht, the non-accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is not becauſe God is not unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but becauſe the threat or promiſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, and the condition thereof was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The third Propoſition is this, That none of thoſe changes, which ſeem to be attributed to God in Scripture, are really oppoſite to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs. I grant, the Scripture ſeveral times repreſents God, ſeemingly at leaſt, under changes to us; ſometimes he is repreſented as being changed from an Enemy to a Friend, to be reconciled to them with whom he was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before; hence we read of his <hi>being pacified towards ſinners, Ezek.</hi> 16.63. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.1.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60044:34"/>
                  <hi>Though thou waſt angry with me,</hi> (ſayes the Church to God) <hi>yet thine anger is turned away.</hi> Again, ſometimes God is repreſented as being changed from a Friend to an Enemy, to be at war with them with whom he was before at peace; So <hi>Job</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thou art become cruel to me;</hi> or, thou are turned or changed, <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou wert good and gracious, but now thou art ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and cruel: So
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>He was turned to be their Enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> Thus both theſe ways God ſeems to be repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der changes; and how then is he unchangeable? Nevertheleſs unchangeable for all this, and to vindicate God's unchangeableneſs notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, I would intreat you to conſider two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that God is unchangeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt various and changeable diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he does or can walk in towards us. 'Tis true, the external diſpenſation changes, his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward courſe and carriage towards us is very changeable and various; now he ſmiles, and then he frowns; now he fills, and then he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes; now he lifts up, and then he caſts down; now he breaks, and then he binds up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the outward dealings and diſpenſations of God are very changeable and various; yet in and under all he himſelf changes not, but is ſtill the ſame, the ſame in his Being, and in his Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the ſame in his Counſel, Covenant, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60044:35"/>and love to us. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi>
25.10. <hi>All the Paths</hi> (that is, the providences and diſpenſations)
<hi>of the Lord, are</hi> ſaid to be <hi>Mercy and Truth to his People:</hi> His Paths towards them are very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſelves, but God's Love and Grace is the ſame in all. The outward diſpenſation of God toward us, it may be, is changed; he did ſmile, but now he frowns; he did give, but now he takes away; he did form Light, but now he creates Darkneſs for us; and hereupon we apprehend that God Himſelf, his Heart, his Counſel, his Covenant, his Love is changed; but 'tis only in our apprehenſion; for indeed, and in truth, he is the ſame ſtill; the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable of his diſpenſations, do not argue the leaſt variableneſs in him at all; and indeed, where he is a Friend, he is a Friend for ever; and where he is an Enemy, he is an Enemy for ever; the change is only in the external diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that the change is in us, and not in God, God is alwayes the ſame, but we are not the ſame; when God is pacified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe with whom he was offended, they are changed, not he, he is the ſame he was; and when he is angry with Saints, with whom he was before at peace, they are changed, not he: the change was in <hi>Job,</hi> not in God, when he ſaid, <hi>thou art turned to be cruel to me;</hi> the change was in the Church, not in God, when <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60044:35"/>he was ſaid to be <hi>turned to be their Enemy. God</hi> (ſays a worthy Divine) <hi>is the ſame, his Love is the ſame, his Wrath is the ſame, his Mercy is the ſame, his Juſtice is the ſame, and that for ever; but we changing are caſt ſometimes under the effects of his Love, and ſometimes under the effects of his Wrath; we are ſometimes under the ſaddeſt droppings of his Juſtice, and ſometimes under the ſweeteſt influences of his Mercy.</hi> As a man that changes his Aſpect, and turns about his Body to another Point of the Heavens, that part of the Heavens which was before at his right hand, is now at his left. Not but that the Heavens are as they were, they change not, either their Poſition or Motion, but the Man hath changed his. So the Wrath and Love, the Juſtice and Mercy of God ſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the ſame point, but we turn, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Juſtice-ward, ſometimes Mercy-ward; now we face his Wrath, and then his Love; thus the change is in us and not in God, and ſo he remains unchangeable ſtill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Propoſition is this, That God's Unchangeableneſs does no way exclude or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the uſe of means: If God be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then to what purpoſe is the uſe of means? Why do we Pray, or Hear, or uſe any means in order to our eternal Good? Why, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, God's Unchangeableneſs does no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude or invalidate the uſe of means; for pray conſider, (Firſt) That God wills the Means as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60044:36"/>well as the End, and the Means in order to the End; he wills our Praying as well as our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, our Hearing as well as our Happineſs, our Sowing as well as our Reaping, our Sowing in the uſe of Means, as well as our Reaping in the Harveſt of Mercy. He wills our believing as well as our bleſſedneſs, he wills the one as well as the other; yea, he wills the one in order to the other, and that with the ſame abſolute immutable and eternal will; <hi>He hath ordained we ſhould walk in good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>he ha h choſen us to Salvation, through the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and the belief of the Truth,</hi> 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. — (Secondly) Conſider, that as God wills the Means as well as the End, ſo through the uſe of theſe it is, that he gives out himſelf and his bleſſings to us, and at laſt brings us to the End: God makes a Covenant with his People, and therein layes himſelf under bonds to do great things for them, as great as a God can do; but he will have them pray for them, nor will he do them but in a way of Prayer, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
36.37. and God tells us, that <hi>he never ſaid to the Seed of Jacoh, Seek ye me in vain, Iſa.</hi> 45.19. Indeed, God is not wanting to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the uſe of mean: <hi>The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeks him, Lam.</hi> 3.26. Ordinarily God will not communicate himſelf and his love any other way, and that Soul that neglects this, puts himſelf out of the way <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60044:36"/>of the Manifeſtations and Communications of God and his Love: Indeed, God has, as it were, tied himſelf to Souls under a conſcientious uſe of means to do them good; <hi>Ask, and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſeek, and you ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to you: for every one that asketh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth; and every one that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it is opened:</hi> As you therefore value communion with God, and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of his Love, take heed of laying aſide the uſe of means. — (Thirdly) Conſider, that theſe things we call means, ſuch as Prayer, Hearing, and the like, are inſtances of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Worſhip, and Obedience to God; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we worſhip God, and give ſo far the Glory to him that is due unto his Name; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to caſt off theſe, is to caſt off the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, and to deny we owe Homage to him. Lay all theſe together, and our Propoſition is clear, that God s Unchangeableneſs does no way exclude or invalidate the uſe of means; and when we uſe means; 'tis not to change, but fulfil the Mind of God, 'tis not to alter, but to accompliſh his Counſels, and bring us into the fruition of them. Thus by theſe Propoſitions, I have vindicated the unchangeableneſs of God from cavil and contradiction, and it remains a truth, that the Lord Jehovah is an unchangeable God.</p>

                  <p> Several doctrinal Corollaries or Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the conſideration of God's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus far aſſerted, opened, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the Unchangeableneſs of God, our next work ſhall be to deduce ſome uſeful Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries or Concluſions thence; and indeed many things of weight, and very momentous to us, may be drawn from what has been ſaid. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. See here the Glorious Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God, and that he is infinitely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from all the creatures in Dignity and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. God, my Beloved, is every way above, and diſtinguiſht from the creatures; He is <hi>the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. and there is hardly any thing wherein his Glorious Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection does more brightly, illuſtriouſly, and tranſcendently appear, and ſhine forth, than in his Unchangeableneſs. The Creatures are all changeable, one way or other, the Heavens and the Earth, with all the furniture of the one and the other, are changeable; <hi>they ſhall periſh, yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment, and be changed as a Veſture, Pſal.</hi> 102.26. The day is <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60044:37"/>coming, wherein <hi>all theſe ſhall be diſſolved,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. Men alſo they are changeable, they indeed are Changeableneſs it ſelf, as it were, they are changeable in their Nature, and changeable in their Condition; changeable in their Spirits, and changeable in their Wayes; changeable in their Counſels, and changeable in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; changeable in all they are; <hi>unſtable as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 49.4. Great Men are changeable,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9. Yea, good Men are changeable, the beſt Men are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the beſt Men at their beſt in this world are changeable,
<hi>Verily, every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity;</hi> (that is, ſubject to change) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. Men are not to day what they were yeſterday, nor will they be to morrow what they are to day; yea, Men are to day, and to morrow they are not; ſo changeable are they. Yea, the Angels, the Bleſſed Angels themſelves are changeable; <hi>God puts no truſt in his Saints, and his Angels, he charges with folly, Job</hi> 4.18. that is, with poſſible, though not actual, folly, with change and folly in their Nature, though not in their Condition: there is, my Beloved, a peccability in the very Angels, I mean, in their Nature: The beſt of Creatures, in themſelves, are ſubject to the worſt of changes; the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels are in their Nature capable of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; indeed, in their Condition they are not, being confirmed in, both all Holineſs and all <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60044:38"/>Happineſs, by the grace of the Second Covenant, but in their Nature they are: Hence that ſaying of one of the School-men;<note place="margin">Cuicunque Creaturae hoc convenit, ut pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care non poſſit, hoc habet ex dono gratiae, non ex conditione na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,
<hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Whatever Creature there is that is impeccable, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, he has not this from himſelf, or in his Nature, but from the Gift of free Grace.</hi> Thus all the Creatures are changeable, but God is unchangeable, he is for ever the ſame. And O how glorious does this ſpeak him to be! And how does it diſtinguiſh him from all the Creatures in Perfection and Glory? The truth is, this is a glorious Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Perfection in it ſelf, and this puts a luſtre and glory upon the Excellencies &amp; Perfections of God; for, <hi>this</hi> (as one ſpeaks)
<hi>is an Attribute, which like the ſilken ſtring through the Chain of Pearl, runs through all the reſt, and puts a glory upon all.</hi> God's Holineſs would not be half ſo glorious, were it not unchangeable Holineſs; his Love would not be half ſo ſweet, were it not unchangeable Love; his Juſtice and Wrath would not be half ſo terrible, were it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Juſtice and Wrath: Indeed, what were any of all his Attributes in compariſon, were they not unchangeable? O! let us learn to ſee and adore God in this glorious Excellency and Perfection of his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the conſideration of God's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60044:38"/>we conclude the tranſcendent excellency of Spiritual Things beyond Carnal, Heavenly things beyond Earthly; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we ſhould prize and purſue the one and the other. This take for an eternal Rule, That the nearer things come to God, and the more they reſemble him, and partake of him, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and deſirable they are. Indeed, as God is the Fountain, ſo he is the Meaſure and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of all true Worth and Excellency; and here is nothing that has any real worth or excellency in it, any further then it reſembles him, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of him. Now, what things do moſt reſemble God and partake of God? are they Spiritual, or Carnal; Heavenly, or Earthly? ſurely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Heavenly Things; God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſo in their kind are theſe: as for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Earthly things, they are fading and changeable, the beſt of them are <hi>Treaſures which moth and ruſt doth corrupt, and which Theives do break through and ſteal, Mat.</hi> 6.19. They are all fadeing, dying, tranſient things:
<hi>The World paſſeth away,</hi> (ſayes Saint John) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. that is, fleeting and periſhing. 'Tis a good Obſervation which
<hi>Calvin</hi> has upon theſe words,<note n="*" place="margin">Quia in mundo ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt niſi caducum, et quaſi momentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; ex eo colligit quam male &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſibi conſulant, qui hic ſibi faelicitatem conſtituunt praeſertim quum al beatam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae vitae gloriam nos Deus vocet.
<hi>Calv.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in the World there is nothing but what is <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60044:39"/>fading, and as it were, but for a moment; the Apoſtle thence concludes, how ill they conſult and provide for themſelves, who carve out to themſelves their happineſs here, eſpecially when God calls us to the bleſſed Glory of eternal Life; and
'tis as if he ſhould ſay, The true happineſs which God offers to his Children is eternal, and therefore moſt unworthy is it in us to incumber our ſelves with this World; which, together with all its good things, will anon vaniſh away.</hi> Pray let us lay this Obſervation to heart, <hi>The world paſſeth away;</hi> that is, Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures, they all fade and change, are ſhort-lived: Alas! how ſoon many times do Riches change into Poverty, Pleaſure into Pain, Honour into Diſgrace and Contempt, Friends into Enemies, Fulneſs into Want? there is no ſtability in any of theſe things, they are ſubject to change every moment: but now Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly Things they are laſting and durable, they are <hi>Treaſures which neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, nor can Theives break through and ſteal them, Mat.</hi> 6.20. The Riches of this World are <hi>uncertain Riches,</hi> vaniſhing, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. but the Riches of Heaven, and the Covenant of God's Love, are certain, durable, and abiding Riches. Grace is a durable Thing, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a durable, unchangeable Thing; Pardon, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Acceptation with God through that Righteouſneſs, are durable Things; Union and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60044:39"/>Communion with God through Chriſt, theſe are unchangeable, theſe live and laſt for ever, where attained; and being ſo, they do come nearer God, they more reſemble him and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more of him than Carnal and Earthly Things do, and ſo are more excellent than they, and ſhould be accordingly prized by us. O, my Beloved, there is more true worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in one dram of Grace, one beam of Holineſs, one hint of the Pardon of ſin, one ſight of God's reconciled Face, one imbrace in the boſom of his Love, than there is in a World of Carual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Contentments; and accordingly we ſhould prize and affect them, our eye and heart ſhould be taken off from the one, and fixt upon the other. But alas! alas! we are apt to dote upon theſe changeable things here below: O how fond are we of, and how paſſionately for the moſt part are we carried out after Carnal, Earthly ſenſible Things? But how cold are we in our love to, and purſuits after Things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly? as if indeed Earthly and not Heavenly things were the only things of weight and moment; whereas indeed the one hath no worth, no glory in them in compariſon of the Glory which excelleth: Let us therefore with the holy <hi>Apoſtle, not look at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen, are temporal; but the <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60044:40"/>things which are not ſeen, are eternal,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. Mark, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not think Carnal and Earthly Things worth a caſt of his eye, becauſe they are temporal, changeable; but Spiritual Things, which are durable and eternal, theſe he counted worthy of his eye, his heart, and all. O, let us meaſure the worth of things by their reſemblance to God, and what they do partake of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behold here, as in a Glaſs, the notorious folly and madneſs of ſuch as prefer the Creature before God, in their choice and affections, placing their happineſs in it, and not in him. <hi>Many</hi> (not one, or two, or a few, but <hi>many</hi>) <hi>ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and what good is it they would have ſhewn them? <hi>Corn, Wine, Oyle, Pſal.</hi> 4.6. Creature-good, ſenſible-good, good to feed and fill a ſenſual Appetite; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is the good which the moſt of men prefer in their choice and affections before God, placing the reſt and happineſs of their Souls therein: The generality of men have high thoughts of the Creature, and low thoughts of God; great affections for the Creature, and ſmall affections for God; 'Tis but here and there one that does truly and indeed carry his happineſs above the road of Creatures, and place it in God: Take the moſt of men, and 'tis the Creature they love, 'tis the Creature they prize, 'tis the Creature they chooſe, and <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60044:40"/>'tis the Creature they take up their reſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in; as for God, they will have none of him; as God complained of them of old, <hi>Iſrael would none of me, Pſal.</hi> 81.11. In a word, God and the Creatures, ſhare the hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the whole World between them; God tenders himſelf to men as the reſt and happineſs of their Souls, and accordingly to be loved, to be prized, to be choſen, to be delighted in by them; on the other hand, the Creatures they tender themſelves to men in like manner, and both plead for acceptation; and which I pray carrys it, God or the Creature? Truly the Creature with the moſt: Alas! we are carnal, and ſenſual, and do naturally incline to carnal and ſenſual things, imbracing them to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, and ſo the Creature is preferred before God: Oh what folly and madneſs is this! to prefer the Creature before God in our choice and affections, is not only to prefer emptineſs before fulneſs, nothingneſs before ſufficiency; but 'tis alſo to prefer vanity before immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and variableneſs before unchangeableneſs; and Oh, what folly, what madneſs is this! to prefer the Creature before God in our choice and affections, is to prefer a broken Ciſtern that can hold no Water, before a Fountain of Living Waters. So God himſelf ſpeaks of it, and withal brands it for a black and horrid evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. an evil which he calls upon the <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60044:41"/>Heavens to be aſtoniſht at, and the Earth to be horribly afraid becauſe of. O, my Beloved, to prefer a Ciſtern before a Fountain; a poor, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſcanty, borrowed Good, before a full, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, original, all-ſufficient Good; a drop before an Ocean of Goodneſs and ſweetneſs, this is great folly; but to prefer a broken Ciſtern, and a broken Ciſtern that can hold no Water, before a Fountain of Living Waters, fleeting nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before unchangeable fulneſs, this is greater folly, folly even to madneſs; and yet this is the folly of the moſt of men. Carnal men are often in <hi>Scripture</hi> called Fools, and their folly appears in nothing more than this; Namely, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring changeable Creatures, before an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God; and indeed, than this what greater folly can there be? In
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. we read of one that talked to his Soul, ſaying,
<hi>Soul, eat, drink, and be merry; for thou haſt much goods laid up for thee for many years, take thine eaſe:</hi> Pray mark, he had never a word of God in his mouth, and (as we may ſafely conclude) never a thought of God in his heart; but he was wholly taken up with his Barnes, and Goods, and Treaſures; and yet he bids his Soul to take its eaſe, to ſit down at reſt; God was as nothing with him, and the Creature was all: Well, what title does Chriſt give him? does he give him the title of a wiſe Man? No, <hi>Thou fool</hi> (ſays he) Chriſt calls him <hi>fool,</hi> as well he might; for what greater <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60044:42"/>folly than this, to be wholly taken up with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Creatures and neglect and forget an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God? yea, and to bid his Soul take its eaſe too, becauſe he abounded with Creature-injoyments: Indeed, had he ſaid, Soul, take thine eaſe, be merry, thou haſt Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures laid up in abundance for thee; God is thine, Chriſt is thine, the Bleſſed Spirit, the Comforter is thine, Heaven, and Eternal Life is thine, this had been ſomething like; but to have his heart taken up with carnal things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, preferring them before God, and to bid his Soul to reſt and be merry upon the account of theſe, this is folly with a witneſs; and who deſerves the name of a Fool, if he did not? What ſhall I ſay? this, namely to prefer the Creature before God, is ſuch folly, as will at laſt expoſe to ſhame and contempt for ever all that are guilty of it, and ſuch are even hung up in Chains for the higheſt inſtances of folly and madneſs: Lo (ſayes the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>this is the man that made not God his Strength, but truſted in the abundance of his Riches, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">q. d. <hi>Conſi erate quam miſer nunc ſit qui antea tam foclix crat. Piſcat. in loc. Videte quis ſit illius exitus.</hi> Muſc. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. Lo, this is the man that preferred the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before God, that made Riches, not God, his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is that Fool, that very Fool, that mad Man; yea, and whoever they are that do <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60044:43"/>this, they will at laſt (though perhaps too late) ſee and find themſelves to be Fools: <hi>At his end</hi> (ſayes the Prophet concerning ſuch an one) <hi>he ſhall be a Fool, Jer.</hi>
17.11. <hi>at his end he ſhall be a fool!</hi> what, was he a wiſe man in his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and progreſs? No, he was a Fool all along; Yet though he was a Fool, he thought himſelf wiſe: but at laſt he ſhall ſee his folly, he ſhall find that he was a very fool indeed, and O how will the ſight of ſuch folly then vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him? O Sirs, when you ſhall ſee your ſelves lanching forth into an unchangeable ſtate, as ſhortly you will, how will you then condemn your ſelves of folly, for preferring changeable Creatures before an unchangeable God? Let me therefore ſpeak to each of you, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? Riches make to themſelves wings, &amp;c. Ceaſe from thine own wiſdom, labour not to be rich:</hi> Men think it to be their higheſt wiſdom to get Riches; but, ſirs, know aſſuredly, this is folly; the onely wiſdom, is to make ſure of God, and get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, Riches are not, but God alwayes is, and he is the ſame for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From God's Unchangeableneſs we infer the abſolute neceſſity of a change in ſinners, if ever they be happy, if ever they be ſaved. My Beloved, if ever ſinners be ſaved, and made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy, there muſt be a change either in God or them; now in God there can be no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60044:44"/>change, the change thereof muſt be in them: 'Tis a rational and undenyable way of arguing, for a ſinner to argue and ſay, God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and becauſe God is unchangeable, I muſt change or periſh, change or die, change or be miſerable for ever: For pray mark, God never did, and he never will ſave any man in his ſins, he is in Chriſt infinitely willing, ready, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave men from their ſins; he ſent and ſeal'd his Son on purpoſe to ſave men from their ſins, and accordingly gave him a Name ſutable hereunto, even <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which ſigniſies a Saviour, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, Mar.</hi> 1.21. But he never did, and unleſs he ſhould change he never will, ſave any in their ſins, without a change therefore in us and upon us, we are undone for ever. But a little further, yet to let you ſee the force of this inference, and the rationality of ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſo it may fall with the greater weight and conviction upon all our Souls; be pleaſed to conſider that 'tis utterly repugnant to, and inconſiſtent with, the Word, Nature, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and Oath of God, to ſave ſinners without a change; for all theſe are abſolutely and expreſly againſt the happineſs and ſalvation of unchanged Souls, Souls remaining ſtill in their ſins, ſtill in their natural ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word of God is againſt the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Salvation of unchanged Souls; the <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60044:45"/>Word of God ſayes expreſly, that without a change, men may not, ſhall not, cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; The Word of God ſays, <hi>the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all that forget God, Pſal.</hi> 9.17. The Word of God ſays, <hi>that into the Holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there ſhall in no wiſe enter any thing that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth or worketh abomination, Rev.</hi> 21.27. The Word of God ſayes, <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. The Word of God ſayes, <hi>that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. And leſt all this ſhould be thought to concern onely profane and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones, let me add, the Word of God ſayes, that
<hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, men in their natural eſtate, <hi>cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. Yea, the Word of God ſayes, and that with an emphaſis, that <hi>except a man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, unleſs</hi> he be regenerated by the Spirit, <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Joh. 3.3.5. <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt)
<hi>except a man be born again, &amp;c.</hi> and again <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> he aſſerts it over and over, which notes among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, as the weight of the Truth aſſerted, ſo our difficulty and averſneſs to believe it, and bow to it: Thus the Word of God is againſt this thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Nature of God is againſt the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation of unchanged Souls; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is infinitely pure and holy, and will not admit of ſinners, to dwell with him: <hi>Thou
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60044:45"/>art not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>neither ſhall evil dwell with thee, Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>The fooliſh</hi> (and ſuch are all men by nature)
<hi>ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight; thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity, v.</hi> 5. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity;</hi> that is, without loathing and deteſtation: God's Nature is holy, yea, 'tis Holineſs it ſelf, and he can as ſoon ceaſe to be God, as ceaſe to be holy; his Nature is infinitely contrary to all ſin, and he infinitely, neceſſarily, and eternally hates all ſin; ſin indeed is ſtrictly and properly the onely Object of God's hatred: His love is et out upon many Objects, but ſin is the only Object of his hatred, and is not the nature of this God againſt the ſalvation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed ſinners? God muſt firſt ceaſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely holy, and ſo to be God, e're ſinners remaining in their unchanged ſtate can be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Counſel of God is againſt the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of unchanged Souls; the Law of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God is, That we muſt be holy, if ever we will be happy; that we muſt be called, juſtified, and ſanctified, if ever we be glorified; ſo you find in that golden Chain, (as tis called) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to be conformed unto the Image of his Son. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60044:46"/>Mark, the Counſel, or as 'tis here called, the fore-knowledge of God, tells us, we muſt be changed, called, and juſtified, if ever we be glorified. So expreſly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath choſen us to ſalvation:</hi> But how? is there no need of a change? Yes, he has ſo choſen us, as calls for a change, <hi>He hath choſen us to ſalvation, through the ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth:</hi> Yea, the Counſel of God aims at holineſs, and deſigns us primarily unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>He hath choſen us that we ſhould be holy,</hi> Eph. 1.4, 5. God muſt change all his Counſels which have been of old, or ſinners muſt be changed, if ever they be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Oath of God is againſt the ſalvation of unchanged ſinners: God's Oath is gone out of his mouth, that no unbelieving, unchanged ones ſhall ever enter into his Reſt: <hi>So I ſware in my wrath, they ſhall not enter into my Reſt, Heb.</hi> 3.11. Thus God's Word, his Nature, his Counſel, his Oath, are all againſt the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Salvation of unchanged ſinners; and God muſt change in all, if ever they be ſaved without a change: But God can change in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the change muſt be in them; God being unchangeable, they muſt change or die, change or periſh; and there muſt be a double change paſs upon them, or they cannot be ſaved, a change of their eſtate, and a change of their image; a change of their ſtate in juſtification by the <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60044:46"/>Blood of Chriſt, and a change of their Image in Regeneration and Sanctification by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; and without both theſe they are undone for ever.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a change of their ſtate in juſtification through Chriſt's Blood, if ever they be ſaved. When a poor Soul is <hi>juſtified freely by Grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. when his ſins are once pardoned, and his perſon accepted with God by the imputation of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſs to him, through believing, then is his ſtate changed, and this change of ſtate ſinners muſt paſs under, or God being unchangeable, they cannot be ſaved; they muſt, through the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt applyed and appropriated in a way of believing, get their ſins pardoned, and their perſons accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they muſt get all Guilt removed, and all Debts paid, or they cannot poſſibly be ſaved; this is frequently mentioned in Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.
<hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Again, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Being juſtified through his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath by him:</hi> Again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18,
19. <hi>If by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteouſneſs ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60044:47"/>to condemnation; ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Still you ſee juſtification through the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is neceſſary unto Life and Salvation. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>God hath made us accepted in the Beloved, in whom we have redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs ſins:</hi> The like is held forth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Oh, without pardon and juſtification through the Blood of Chriſt, there is no Life, no Salvation to be expected for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Unpardoned ſin will ſurely damn, and no pardon is to be had for ſinners but in and by Chriſt, and union with Chriſt, through belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. When once a Soul is pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt, through believing, then he is <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.24. but till then he remains in Death, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Death and Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be a change of their Image in Regeneration and Sanctification by the Spirit of Chriſt. When a ſinner is new born,
<hi>born of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Spirit,</hi> as Chriſt's expreſſion is, when he is made <hi>a new Creature, old things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt away with him, and all things being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> phraſes it, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. when he is <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and has a ſound Work of Grace wrought and carried on in him by the Spirit of Chriſt, then is his Image changed, and ſuch a change of Image muſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners paſs under, or they cannot be ſaved: God <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60044:47"/>never did, and never will ſave an unrenewed Soul, his unchangeableneſs will not admit of the ſalvation of ſuch an one; And indeed the Scripture is full in it,
<hi>Job.</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> (ſaies Chriſt to
<hi>Nicodemus</hi>) <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God:</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>except a man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> You ſee this is what Chriſt aſſerts, and that over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and with the higheſt aſſeverations imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: Hence alſo Heaven is ſaid to be <hi>the Inbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Saints, Col.</hi> 1.12. and of <hi>ſanctified Ones, Acts</hi> 26.18. Hence the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> as well as <hi>juſtified,</hi> and ſo made capable of <hi>inheriting the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
6.10, 11. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. God is ſaid, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy to ſave us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thus there muſt a change of Image as well as State paſs upon us, or we cannot be ſaved; and that becauſe God is unchangeable: Oh, how ſhould we all therefore look after this change? Soul, aſſure thy ſelf,
'tis not thy civility and morality, how much ſoever raiſed and refined;
'tis not thy external reformations; 'tis not thy conforming thy ſelf to the outward Rules and Laws of Duty, and the like, that will ſave thee, or avail thee any thing as to eternal Life; unleſ; thou comeſt under this double change, of which <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60044:48"/>thou haſt heard. <hi>Paul,</hi> I am confident, could compare with thee for morality &amp; external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law, when yet he was in a loſt eſtate; and afterwards coming to faith in Chriſt, he ſees cauſe <hi>to account all but as loſs and dung, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>begin.</hi> And he that came to Chriſt, (of whom we read in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) had certainly attained to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of morality, and external conformity to the Law, who yet was lacking, and ſo far lacking, as that, for any thing we find, he fell eternally ſhort of Heaven and Salvation. Oh, there muſt a change, a change of State, and a change of Image paſs upon us, or our morality will leave us at laſt to periſh: Let us therefore mind this change: Am I changed or no? Changed I muſt be, and that with a great change, with a change of State, and a change of perſon, or I cannot be ſaved; have I therefore any acquaintance with ſuch a change? O, my Beloved, let unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God ingage us all to look out after a change in us; God will not change to ſave any of us all, he is willing to change us that we may be ſaved, but he himſelf will not change to ſave any of us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, from what has been declared touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Unchangeableneſs, we conclude and infer the infinite ſweetneſs of his Love, and the infinit bitterneſs of his Wrath, and ſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happineſs of ſuch as are intereſted in the <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60044:48"/>one, and the extream miſery of ſuch as fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other. Sinners ſlight God's Love, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Creature-love before it; and they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard his Wrath, wilfully provoking it againſt themſelves; but if they will view the one and the other, in the Glaſs of his Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they will find that there is more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the one, than that it ſhould be ſlighted; and more terribleneſs in the other, than that it ſhould be diſregarded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From God's Unchangeableneſs, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and infer the infinite ſweetneſs of his Love, and ſo the happineſs of them that are intereſted in it. God has a people whom he loves, and his Love to them is a free love, a rich Love, a peculiar Love, a Love of ſingular eminency and perfection in all reſpects: But that which indeed crowns all, and puts an infinite ſweetneſs into it is this, that 'tis an Unchangeable Love, a Love that never fades, never varies: True, his Love may be, and ſometimes is, vailed and clouded; but though it be vailed, yet 'tis not varied; though it be ſometimes clouded, yet 'tis never changed: Love, under a Vail or Cloud, is Love. The Sun may be under a Cloud, yea, there may be an eclipſe upon it for a time, which may keep it out of our view, and deprive us of the comfortable influences and ſhinings of it for a ſeaſon; but yet even then the Sun is in being, and after a while it will ſhine again, and that as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60044:49"/>ſweetly, brightly, and comfortably, as ever. So there may be a Vail, a Cloud, an eclipſe, as it were, upon God's Love, ſuch as may deprive us for a time of the comfortable views, ſhinings, and influences of it: but yet, even then 'tis Love, and ſweet Love too, and after a while it will ſhine and ſhew it ſelf again. 'Tis a ſweet Word which you have
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>His anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a right, but joy comes in the morning. in his favour is life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vitam momento op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit, benevolentia qua ſuos complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Deus, durat per emnem vitam &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us favorem ſuum prorogat in longum tempus. <hi>Mol.</hi>
                  </note> Life here (as a judicious Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerves) is oppoſed to a moment, mentioned in the beginning of the verſe; and ſo the ſenſe is, that that Love wherewith God loves his People laſts throughout all life, it lives and laſts for ever, 'tis a durable abiding love: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8. <hi>In a little wrath I bid my face from thee, for a moment;</hi> (ſayes God to his Church) <hi>but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee.</hi> Thus, I ſay, though God's Love to his People may be vailed, yet 'tis never varyed; 'tis a conſtant Love, and Oh how ſweet does this ſpeak his Love to be, and how happy are they that are intereſted in it? Oh, to be beloved by an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God, with an Unchangeable Love, this is ſweet indeed! The Creatures Love has <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60044:49"/>little worth or ſweetneſs in it, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of its weakneſs and emptineſs, but alſo becauſe of its changeableneſs: Alas! the Creature loves to day, and hates to morrow; Oh, but now God's Love is another manner of Love, a Love that has fulneſs and firmneſs, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and immutability both in it; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly muſt needs be infinitely ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable: Well therefore might <hi>David</hi> admiring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out as he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
36.7. <hi>How excellent or how precious is thy loving-kindneſs, O Lord?</hi> and as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving-kindneſs is better than life:</hi> 'Tis before all lives; one dram of it is to be preferred before many Worlds of Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injoyments. God's Love, it is all good, all comfort, all happineſs in its fountain-fulneſs and purity; it is an eternal never-failing ſpring of ſweetneſs, an unvariable fountain of delight; in it there is Grace, all Grace; Peace, all Peace; Joy, all Joy; Satisfaction, all Satisfaction; Reſt and Solace, all Reſt and Solace: O Soul, look upon the love of thy God to thee, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and in it thou wilt ſee unſearchable Riches, unmeaſurable Fulneſs, unfathomable Depths, and (which crowns all) eternal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs; and Oh how happy wilt thou therein ſee thy ſelf! With what full conſolation of Spirit mayeſt thou ſit down and ſay, God loves me, and he loves me unchangeably. Friends change, outward comforts change, I <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60044:50"/>my ſelf change; but God's Love to me changes not, I am for ever upon his heart, nor can either Men or Devils, ſins or ſorrows caſt me out of it. True, he ſometimes afflicts me, but yet he loves me; he ſometimes frowns upon me, but yet he loves me; he ſometimes ſeems to ſlay me, he breaks me with breach upon breach, but yet he loves me; he confines me to a ſick Chamber, he layes me upon a ſick Bed, he ſeems to reſolve to lay me in the Duſt, but yet he loves me; yea, all this is in love: I break with him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, I am ſinning againſt him every day and hour; but yet he loves me, he loves me notwithſtanding all, his Love cannot be broken off from me, and after a while I ſhall bathe in the Fountain thereof for ever. Oh ſweet! who would not long for this Love? He loves me unchangeably, and he will therefore cleanſe me, purifie me, pardon me, make me perfectly holy: He loves me, and he will love me, till he has lodged me in his own <hi>Preſence</hi> and
<hi>Boſom</hi> above, and there he will love me for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From God's Unchangeableſs we conclude and infer the infinite bitterneſs of his Wrath, and the extream miſery of all ſuch as fall under the weight thereof. God's Love is not more ſweet than his Wrath is bitter, his Love is not more deſirable than his Wrath is formidable, and that becauſe he is an Unchangeable God; and oh how miſerable muſt they be that do fall under <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60044:50"/>this Wrath. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.6. we read of <hi>the People of God's Wrath:</hi> there are ſome then that are properly
<hi>the People of God's Wrath,</hi> they are <hi>Children of Wrath, Heirs of Wrath;</hi> and Wrath, yea God's Wrath, will be their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever; ſuch are all finally impenitent and unbelieving Ones, all who live and die in their impenitency and unbelief; and oh how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly miſerable muſt they be! God's Wrath is a <hi>great Wrath, a fierce Wrath, a ſore Wrath, a powerful Wrath, an irreſiſtible Wrath, a burning, conſuming, and devouring Wrath;</hi> So the Scripture ſpeaks of it: all which ſpeaks the exceeding bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and terribleneſs of it, and the extream miſery of ſuch as fall under it; but that which adds even infinitely to all is this, that 'tis eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unchangeable Wrath, Wrath that abides for ever: Hence 'tis ſet forth in Scripture by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire, Mat.</hi> 3.12. God's Wrath is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fire,</hi> becauſe of its exceeding heat and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being of a conſuming and devouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and 'tis called <hi>unquenchable Fire,</hi> becauſe 'tis durable and unchangeable, it being what admits of no more change or period than his Love does; and to fall under this unquenchable fire, under the revelation of this eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Wrath; oh how ſad, how miſerable muſt this be? <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Wrath of a King, is as the roaring of a Lyon, Prov.</hi> 19.12. and what then, and how terrible is the Wrath <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60044:51"/>of God; to whoſe Wrath, the wrath of all the Kings on the Earth is as nothing? We are afraid ſometimes of Man's Wrath, yea, ſo afraid of it, as to ſuffer our ſelves to be driven from our duty by it: But, my Beloved, what is the Wrath of a Man to the Wrath God; What is the Wrath of a changeable Man, to the Wrath of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God? let me ſay to each Soul of you, as God by the Prophet to them,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51, 12.13. <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die,</hi> (a changeable Creature) <hi>and forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker?</hi> 'Tis but a little while and Man and his Wrath both ſhall change and die, but God and his Wrath will live for ever: O, learn to fear and tremble at his Wrath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how for a little fading, changeable delight in ſin, you throw your ſelves under unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wrath and fury: Poor ſinner, thou makeſt light of God's Wrath, as if it were an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thing; witneſs thy wilful and daily provoaking of it againſt thee by ſin; witneſs thy inſenſibleneſs of and under the tokens and revelations of it; witneſs thy neglect of Chriſt, and of making thy peace with God by him, and the like: but Soul, view it in the Glaſs of his infinite Unchangeableneſs, and then ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a thing to be made light of or no; the Saints they tremble but in the apprehenſion of it;
<hi>Who knows he power of thine Anger?</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, Pſal.</hi>
90.11. They ſigh, they bleed, they groan, <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60044:51"/>yea, they die, and are even diſtracted under a little temporal ſprinklings and droppings of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15.16. yea they dread and tremble many times at but the revelation of it againſt others; <hi>I was afraid,</hi> (ſayes
<hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>of the anger and hot diſpleaſure, wherewith the Lord was wrath againſt you, to deſtroy you, Deut.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Moſes</hi> could contemn the Wrath of man, yea of Man whoſe Wrath of all men is moſt terrible, the Wrath of a King, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. but yet he trembles at the Wrath of God, when 'twas provoaked againſt others; thus the Saints tremble at God's Wrath: yea more, the Devils themſelves do dread and tremble at God's Wrath; <hi>the Devils believe and tremble, Jam.</hi> 2.19. they believe there is a God, and they tremble at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Wrath of that God. And ſinner, whoever thou art, how light ſoever thou mayeſt now make of God's Wrath, yet know that there is a time coming, when thou and the ſtouteſt ſinners in the World muſt and will tremble at it. See that one text,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hypocrite:</hi> Why, what is the matter? Verily nothing but the ſight and apprehenſion of God's Wrath and Vengeance coming upon them; ſo much the following words ſhew; <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> They ſaw God's Wrath to be as a devouring fire; they ſaw <pb n="80" facs="tcp:60044:52"/>the terror of it in the Glaſs of God's Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and therefore call it
<hi>everlaſting burnings;</hi> and this filled them with dread and trembling. Take one place more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17. We find ſome <hi>crying out to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and rocks, to fall on them, and hide them from the face of him that ſitteth upon the throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb; For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the great day of his Wrath is come, and who ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand?</hi> Well, but who are they that thus cry out? Surely they are onely a company of low-ſpirited Creatures, thinkeſt thou, they are only ſome Women and Children, or ſome baſe cowardly Ones, that never had the Spirit and Courage of Men: No Soul, they are no ſuch Perſons, they are <hi>the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the mighty Men, and every bond-man and every free-men;</hi> all ſorts of Men, Men of the higheſt place, the higheſt eſtates, the higheſt courage and valour, as well as others; theſe all are ſaid <hi>to hide themſelves in the Dens and in the Rocks of the Mountains, and call unto the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Rocks, ſaying, Fall on us.</hi> Oh, but we ſhall fall heavy; no matter, fall on us; but to what purpoſe? Why, <hi>to hide us from the Wrath of God;</hi> why, what is the matter, are you afraid of the Wrath of God? Time was you ſlighted and diſregarded it, as an inconſiderable thing, and do you ſo dread it now, and tremble at it <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60044:52"/>now, that you cry to us, Rocks and Mountains to fall on you, to hide you from it? Oh yes, good Rocks, good Mountains, fall on us, you will lie light and eaſie upon us in compariſon of what the Wrath of God will do. How? Why ſhould you think ſo? You had other thoughts of God's Wrath a while agoe, why do you ſo dread it and tremble at it now? O, becauſe <hi>the great day of his Wrath is come, and none can ſtand before it,</hi> ſay they: We lookt on this Wrath, a while agoe, at a diſtance, and then it ſeemed a light thing; but now <hi>the day,</hi> yea, <hi>the great day of his Wrath is come,</hi> and there is no ſtanding for us: while we lookt at it at a diſtance, we could ſtand before it, and make light of it; yea, in ſome leſſer dayes of Wrath we have born up well enough; but now his Wrath is come near us, yea, and the fulneſs and fierceneſs of it is breaking forth againſt us; now we ſee this Wrath to be more dreadful and formidable, and that we can never ſtand up either under it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: Say ye ſo, reply the Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, then no wonder you cry to us to hide you from it; but truly 'tis more then we can do for you, you muſt now bear and graple with that wrath for ever, as to any relief we can afford you in the caſe. O ſinner! when the great day of God's Wrath ſhall come, then, if not before, thou alſo wilt tremble at his Wrath: Indeed now wouldeſt thou ſee it, and tremble at it,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60044:53"/>thou mighteſt cry to a Rock that could and would hide thee from it, provided thou getteſt into it; I mean <hi>Chriſt, that Rock of Ages,</hi> he being imbraced by Faith, and thy Soul having union with him, would hide and ſecure thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wrath of God for ever; but if thou wilt go on to make light of this Wrath, and to provoke it daily againſt thee by ſin, thou wilt at laſt ſink under the weight and burthen thereof for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the Glaſs of God's Unchangeableneſs, we ſee the true reaſon why the beſt of us all are not conſumed, and accordingly let us give the glory of it, where 'tis due. Beloved, why are you, and I, and others, not conſumed? True, we meet with ſome afflictions, and are exerciſed with ſome diſticulties now and then, but why are we not utterly conſumed and deſtroyed? Verily, 'tis not becauſe we are able to ſave our ſelves, nor is it becauſe we deſerve that God ſhould ſave us, but
'tis purely and ſolely becauſe our God is unchangeable: This account the Text it ſelf gives of it; <hi>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not conſumed:</hi> All our ſecurity lies in God's Immutability, we periſh not, becauſe he changes not: Pray give me leave a little to be free with you and my ſelf; Why are we not conſumed with an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſumption? We are ſorely broken many of us, 'tis true, we are broken in our Eſtates, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60044:53"/>in our Healths, in our Comforts, in our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but why are we not utterly deſtroyed? Why are we alive? Why have we any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort about us? Yea more, why are we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with an eternal conſumption? Why are the beſt of us all not in Hell? Why are we not ſtated in an eternity of woe and miſery? Why are we not now roaring and ſweltering under the Wrath of God? Why are we not Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with Devils and damned Spirits in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings? Is it becauſe our ſins are few and ſmall, and have not deſerved it? No ſurely; Why then is it? Becauſe our God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unchangeable in Being, Counſel, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Love. Oh! my Beloved, if we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what we are, and how we have carryed it; what our ſins and provocations have been, and how high they riſe againſt the bleſſed God, and the like, we may well wonder we are out of Hell, that we have a being any where on this ſide the Pit of Perdition; nor can we reſolve it into any other cauſe but God's Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Let me therefore entreat you to conſider things a little, that you may give glory where 'tis due.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider what you are, I mean, as to your nature and the depravedneſs of it: You are a meer lump and maſs of ſin, <hi>Enemyes, yea, enmity</hi> it ſelf <hi>againſt God</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi>

O, the riſings of ſin, and oh the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of iniquity, that are found among us!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider what you have done, and how you have carried it God-ward: If you ſeriouſly conſider things, you will find, I fear, that you have done, and to this day do, little elſe but ſin againſt the Lord: You have deſpiſed his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, abuſed his Love, violated his Laws, trampled upon his Authority, grieved his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wounded his Son, darkned his Glory, and oftentimes ſtruck even at his very Crown and Being; yea, and <hi>this has been your manner from your youth,</hi> (as God charged them of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21.) there is not that day, nor ſcarcely that hour, wherein you have not, and do not ſin againſt God: often <hi>have you made him ſerve with your ſins, and wearied him with your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.24. Your lives have <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60044:54"/>been lives of ſin for the moſt part againſt God.</p>

1.13. and he is once and again in Scripture repreſented as a God hating ſin; ſin indeed is infinitely odious in his ſight. Now let us weigh theſe things, and lay them together, and then we ſhall ſee that it can be nothing elſe that keeps us from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but God's Unchangeableneſs, to which <pb n="87" facs="tcp:60044:55"/>therefore we ſhould give the glory: 'Tis the Grace and Love of God that firſt brings us into a condition of Life and Salvation, and 'tis the Unchangeableneſs of God that keeps us there. Truly, when ſome of us reflect a little upon our ſelves, and conſider what we are, and have been in our Spirits and carriages God-ward; how much we have provoked him, what frequent forfeitures we have made, and do make of our Lives, Souls, and all, we ſee infinite cauſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we are alive, that the flames of divine Wrath had not long ſince kindled upon us, and the revenges of divine Juſtice broken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; and bleſſed be God, that we are out of Hell. O, that ſuch a proud, ſuch a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, ſuch a ſtiff-necked people, as we are, ſhould yet live! that perſons of ſo many and high provocations againſt God, as thou Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and I are guilty of, ſhould yet have a being out of Hell! This is ſolely from the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of God: And my Beloved, we do not rightly conſider the matter, if we do not ſee, and acknowledge it to be ſo. O bleſſed be God for his unchangeableneſs! had not God been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, where had I now been? I had now been ſhut up in the infernal Pit; I had now been a companion with Devils and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; I had now been ſeparated from God for ever; and how miſerable then had I been?

               <argument>
                  <p> Several grounds of humbling from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God's Unchangeableneſs, as our unlikeneſs to him therein, our charging him with change, our living ſo little upon his Unchangeableneſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the Unchangeableneſs of God is very teaching and inſtructive, ſo alſo very humbling, if rightly weighed and improved by us: there are ſeveral things which the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof do call aloud upon us to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for, and Oh that we would lay them to heart!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is God unchangeable? Then how ſhould we be humbled for our exceeding great change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and therein our unlikeneſs to God, the chief good? The more changeable we are in what is good, the more unlike God we are; and the more unlike God we are, the more cauſe we have of humbling. Oh, how ſhould we loath our ſelves, and be abaſed at the foot of God in the ſenſe of our great fickleneſs and <pb n="89" facs="tcp:60044:56"/>changeableneſs? Alas! how changeable are we in all that is good? how changeable are many of us in our Judgments and Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>like Children toſſed to and fro, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> as you have it <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. being apt <hi>to be ſoon removed from the Faith of the Goſpel,</hi> as the <hi>Galatians</hi> were, at which <hi>Paul marvelled, Gal.</hi> 1.6. How change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are we in our affections to God, and the things of God? Now the heart flames with love to God and Chriſt, anon 'tis chill and cold. Now we are full of holy longings and deſires after God, and Chriſt, Grace, and Glory; we can ſay with the Church of old, <hi>The deſire of our Soul is unto thee, O God, and to the remembrance of thy Name, Iſa.</hi> 26.8. yea, <hi>our Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God;</hi> Yea, <hi>as the Hart pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth after the Water-brooks, ſo panteth our Soul after God,</hi> as the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks: Anon there is not any one holy breathing to be found within us: No, we are even made up of worldly, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unclean deſires; <hi>we pant after the duſt of the Earth,</hi> as thoſe
<hi>Amos</hi> 2.7. we are athirſt for the Creature, and nothing but that will ſatisfie us. Now we delight in God and his Wayes; <hi>We rejoce in the Lord, and our Soul is joyful in our God,</hi> as 'twas with the Church
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. and his Wayes are ſweet and pleaſant to us, his Law is our delight; anon we reliſh no ſweetneſs, we take and excerciſe no joy, no delight, either in <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60044:57"/>the one or in the other; but we drive on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, every duty being a burthen to us, and the very thoughts of God a trouble. Now we fear and ſtand in a we of God, not daring to ſin againſt him; we ſtand in awe of his Preſence; we ſtand in awe of his Holineſs; we ſtand in awe of his Goodneſs; we ſtand in awe of his Power, and the like; Anon we are fearleſs and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of him, boldly venturing upon ſinning againſt him: Now we dread ſin as Hell it ſelf, yea, and worſe too; anon we imbrace it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it. Again, how changeable are we in our holy purpoſes and reſolutions? We take up this and that holy reſolution; we purpoſe to walk ſo and ſo with God, to keep ſuch and ſuch a watch over our ſpirits and wayes; to live more in communion with God; to drive a greater trade and deſign for Heaven, and to haſten more to that better Countrey, and the like; but alas! how do ſuch reſolutions fade, and change, and die within us, not one of many of them ever proves firm and effectual; yea, many times no ſooner are ſuch reſolutions taken up by us, but preſently we run Counter to them, and break with God more than before; the firſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that comes turns us quite beſide our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and we miſerably miſcarry in the very things we reſolved about: Our holy purpoſes are for the moſt part abortive, <hi>We turn aſide like a deceitful bow</hi> (as God complains of thoſe <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60044:57"/>78.57. 'Tis a ſad complaint which I have read in one of the Ancients; <hi>Oftentimes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have I promiſed &amp; refolved to amend,</hi>

                  <hi>but I never made it good, but alwayes I returned to ſin, and to my former wickedneſſes; I added new, and worſe, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reformed as I ought.</hi> And who of us may not in a great meaſure make the ſame complaint? Yet once more, How changeable are we in our ways and walkings? How uneven and unconſtant in our goings? We have
<hi>an heart that loveth to wander,</hi> (as God ſpeaks of them of old
<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10.) O the turnings aſide, and O the turnings back that we are guilty of in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God! Oh the gaps and pauſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions that are in our obedience! we ſhould go on in one even conſtant tenure of holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but alas! we are in and out, off and on often in the day, yea in the hour; yea many times, ſudden and great changes are found in our ſpirits and carriages God-ward, and that for the worſe. I'le give you one, and but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this, and that in an eminently holy Man, an inſtance that may well make all of us tremble, and that is of
<hi>Jeremiah Jer.</hi> 20.13, 14, 15. <hi>Sing unto the Lord, praiſe ye the Lord; for he hath delivered the Soul of the poor from the hand of evil
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60044:58"/>doers. Curſed be the day wherein I was horn; let not the day wherein my mother bare me be bleſſed. Curſed be the man that brought tidings to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, A man-child is born unto thee, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him very glad.</hi> Pray mark, what a great change there was wrought in this good man's ſpirit, and that all of a ſudden; in <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. he looks like one dropt out of Heaven, praiſing God for his Goodneſs and Salvation, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon others ſo to do; but in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. he looks rather like one broken looſe out of Hell, curſing himſelf, and almoſt every one about him. In the one he looks more like an Angel than an imperfect Saint; in the other he looks more like a Devil, than a Man; ſo great was the change in his ſpirit, and this ſuddenly made. When he had in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 13. been praiſing God, and was, as it were, taken up to Heaven, the very next news you hear of him is, that he is full of curſing: and truly thus changeable are we all here. O how ſuddenly many times do we change and fall from the beſt into the worſt of frames and carriages before God? from love, to hatred; from faith, to unbelief; from holy fear, to carnal ſecurity; from obedience to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; from delight in God, to a neglect of God, and a weariedneſs of his wayes and preſence. O let us be humbled for this our exceeding changeableneſs, and therein our unlikeneſs to God in his Unchangeableneſs.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60044:58"/>
               <p n="2">2. Is God unchangeable? Then how ſhould we be humbled that we do ſo often wrong God, charging him with unconſtancy and change, as we do? Such, my Beloved, is the emnity and unbelief of our hearts, that we are apt, upon all occaſions, to take up hard thoughts of God, and bring in black charges againſt him: Now we charge him with weakneſs, and anon with folly; now with unfaithfulneſs, and anon with, unjuſtice; now with cruelty, and anon with change; which is a great evil, and calls for great humbling: God is unchangeable, and he ſtands much upon the glory of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and yet we charge him with change: what an affront is this? This the Pſalmiſt, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, came near unto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9.
<hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his Mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his Promiſefail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger ſhut up his tender Mercies?</hi> What is all this but in effect a charging of God with change? He is here even upon the point of concluding, that God is not the God he was, that he is not ſo merciful, nor ſo faithful, nor ſo gracious, as formerly he was: 'Tis as if he ſhould have ſaid, God was a God of Mercy, Mercy pleaſed him, but now his Mercy is at an end, and he is become all ſeverity; he was faithful in his Promiſes, but now his Promiſes fail, and fail utterly: he was a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60044:59"/>Gracious God, Grace was his darling Attribute, but now his Grace is forgotten by him: Thus for a time he did charge God with change, though after wards, as the context tells us, his Faith recovered it ſelf, and he came to right thoughts of God again. Job alſo was deeply involved in this guilt, <hi>Job</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thou art turned to be cruel to me</hi> (ſayes he to God) thou wert a kind, but now thou art a cruel God to me. The Church alſo is full of this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. and ſhe ſpeaks it out,
<hi>Sion ſaid, the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> q.d. God is ehanged, he is not the God <hi>he</hi> was: Thus I ſay, though God be unchangeable, yet we are apt to charge him with change; we are apt to think that he is neither what he was, nor where he was; that he is either not ſo good as he was, or alſo not ſo great, ſo powerful, ſo wiſe, ſo holy, ſo faithful, ſo gracious as he was, and the like:
<hi>Behold</hi> (ſayes the Prophet) <hi>the Lord's Hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave; neither is his Ear heavy, that it cannot hear,</hi> Iſa. 59.1. They thought and concluded that God's Hand was ſhortned, that is, that his <hi>Power</hi> was leſſened, and that he was not as able to ſave now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; they thought and concluded, that his Ear was grown heavy, that is, that he was not ſo good, and kind, and ready to hear their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now as formerly; he was a God able to ſave, but now, ſay they, he is not, he was a Prayer-hearing <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60044:59"/>God, but now, ſay they, he is not: Thus they were ready to charge him with change: but, ſayes the Prophet, there is no ſuch matter, God is what he was, his Power is the ſame, and his readineſs to hear, and help, and ſave is the ſame that ever it was. There are, among others, two caſes eſpecially in which we are apt to charge the unchangeable God with change; one is, when we change in our carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and behaviour towards God; the other is, when God's carriages and diſpenſations are changed towards us; for indeed we are apt to meaſure God, and judge of him by his out ward carriage and diſpenſations towards us; and when they are changed, we conclude he is changed: in <hi>Gen.</hi>
31.2. 'tis ſaid, <hi>that Jacob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Countenance of Laban, and behold it was not toward him as before:</hi> So we many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Countenance of God, his outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and diſpenſation towards us, and 'tis not towards us as before, his Countenance is chang'd; and becauſe his Countenance is not, we think his Heart is not toward us as formerly, but is changed. O, my Beloved, let us take heed of this grand evil, of charging God with change; 'tis indeed a grand evil, 'tis what is very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and provoaking to God, and
'tis what layes the Soul under much deep-dyed guilt; 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to rob God of one of the brighteſt Jewels in his Crown; yea, 'tis to un-God him: for if
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60044:60"/>he be changeable, he is not God; tremble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Reader, and tremble, O my Soul, at the thoughts of ſuch a thing as this, namely, to charge the Unchangeable One with change.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is God unchangeable? Then how ſhould we be humbled that we live ſo much upon the Creature, and ſo little upon God; ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creature that does change, and ſo little upon God that changes not? If we reflect feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon our ſelves, we ſhall find, (at leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us) that we live more upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than we do upon God; more upon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns, than we do upon this Fountain of Living Waters; at leaſt, the beſt and holieſt of us will find, that we live too much upon the Creature, and too little upon God; witneſs the eagerneſs, ſtrength, and vehemency of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnes after the Creature more than after God, and communion with God: Alas! how paſſionately many times do we long, and how vigorouſly do we purſue after the Creature, when we can be content well enough without God and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God? Witneſs the frequency of our thoughts and contemplations of and about the Creature, more than of God and about God. Alas! <hi>we mind earthly things,</hi> as thoſe did <hi>Phil.</hi>
3.19. but how ſeldom do we think of God, and contemplate God? Now that which is moſt in our thoughts, that we live moſt upon, witneſs our delight and complacency in the Creature, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60044:60"/>more than in God. O, what freſh, ſpringing, vigorous delights have we many times in the Creature? but when, and how little do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light our ſelves in God? Now that which we take moſt delight and complacency in, that do we live moſt upon. Witneſs our immoderate griefs, and the bitterneſs of Spirit, we are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in for the loſs or withdrawment of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, more than for the loſs and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and his Preſence from us. Let this or the other Creature-comfort be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, and how do we take on uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And what bitterneſs of Soul are we filled withall? Then with <hi>Hagar we lift up our voice and weep, Gen.</hi> 21.19. How did <hi>Jonah,</hi> that good Man, take on when the Gourd was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.7, 8, 9. But how ſeldom do we grieve, and bleed, and mourn for want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God? Yea, how, indifferent for the moſt part are we whether we have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God or no? And what does this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, but that we live too much upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and too little upon God? Thus if we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon our ſelves, we ſhall find, by theſe, and ſuch like things as theſe, that we live more upon the Creatures than we do upon God; and, O how humbling ſhould this be upon us! The Creatures, they are vain, fading, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, they are even vanity it ſelf, and changeableneſs it ſelf; but God is an eternal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60044:61"/>Good; He is the ſame for ever, an unchangeable Fountain of all Goodneſs, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Bleſſedneſs, and Delight: Now to live upon theſe changeable Creatures, and not upon this unchangeable God, this is a great evil, and calls for great mourning and humbling at our hands.

               </argument>
               <p>EVery Attribute or Perfection of God, has a revenue of Honour and Glory due to it from the Creature; and 'tis a great part of both the Wiſdom and Duty of the Creature, to give to each Attribute and Perfection of his, its proper Glory. God is pleaſed to reveal and diſcover himſelf, ſometimes in one, and ſometimes in another Attribute of his; ſometimes he reveals and diſcovers himſelf in his Wiſdom, ſometimes in his Power, ſometimes in his Holineſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his Faithfulneſs, ſometimes in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſometimes in his Grace, ſometimes in his Greatneſs, and ſometimes, as here, in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs; now, I ſay, a great part of a Chriſtians skill and duty lies in this, To give to each Attribute, in which God reveals himſelf, its proper Glory, that is to ſay, to honour God ſuitable to the preſent Revelation he makes of <pb n="101" facs="tcp:60044:62"/>himſelf. Now God being unchangeable, our work and care ſhould be, to give him the Glory of his Unchangeableneſs, which, let me tell you, is very dear to him. But how may we give God the glory due to this Attribute of his? Take only theſe few plain Directions as to that breifly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would we give God the Glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs? then let us get our hearts deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with this Attribute of his, being in an holy manner overawed therewith. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of God is an aweful Attribute, an Attribute that chalenges much holy awe and dread from the Creature; and when our hearts are indeed in an holy manner over-awed with the ſenſe of this Attribute, and we are filled with a reverential regard of
<hi>God,</hi> as he is an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God, then do we give him the Glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: This ſeems to be pointed at, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.4.5. <hi>in verſ.</hi> 4.

<hi>verſ.</hi> 5. you have the Iſles affected and over-awed with this Attribute of his; <hi>the Iſles ſaw it, and feared:</hi> Accordingly, if we would indeed give God the glory of his Unchangeableneſs, we ſhould labour to get our hearts over-awed with the ſenſe and apprehenſion thereof; we ſhould dwell much in the meditation of this Perfection <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60044:63"/>of God; our language ſhould be, Well, how changeable ſoever we are; yet God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he is for ever the ſame, unchangeable in Greatneſs, unchangeable in Goodneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in Wiſdom, unchangeable in Power, unchangeable in Holineſs, unchangeable in Faithfulneſs, unchangeable in Fulneſs and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; he is every way an unchangeable God, what he was, he is; what he is, he will be for ever: Thus we ſhould ſit down and contemplate this Attribute, till we find our hearts affected and over-awed by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would we give God the glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs? Then let us aſcribe this Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to God, and celebrate his Glory in it. In

<hi>God,</hi> and we adore thee for thine Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; how fading ſoever the creatures are, thou art ſtill the ſame: In like manner ſhould we do, we ſhould aſcribe Unchangeableneſs to God, and be much in admiring and adoring him for, and in this perfection of his; this is all that we can do, and 'tis indeed our Glorifying of him, to diſplay and make mention of the excellencies and perfections of God, and with both our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Tongues to celebrate the glory of them, which indeed will be our work for ever; O let us be much in it now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Would we give God the Glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs? Then let us ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him and his Unchangeableneſs to be the ſole Spring and Fountain of all that Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, that either Men or Angels do attain <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60044:64"/>unto; the Creatures, Men and Angels not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, in themſelves are all changeable; but yet there is a bleſſed Unchangeableneſs which ſome of them, I mean, the Saints and holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do at laſt attain unto; they are (as the School-men ſpeak of them) <hi>in omni bono confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati,</hi> eternally and unchangeably confirmed in all Good, in all Holineſs, all Happineſs; And whence comes this to paſs? Verily, from the Unchangeableneſs of God, that is the Spring and Fountain of all: were not God unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unchangeable in his Covenant, Counſel, and Love, they would never arrive to ſuch an Unchangeableneſs; to God's Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore we ſhould give the glory of it. Look, as Chriſt ſaid in another caſe, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo, Joh.</hi> 14.19. So may God ſay, both to Men and Angels, becauſe I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, therefore ſhall ye be unchangeable alſo: Indeed, the Unchangeableneſs which Saints and Angels do attain unto is but a beam, as it were, of God's Unchangeableneſs, emitted down upon them; they ſhall be unchangeably holy, becauſe God is ſo; they are unchangeably bleſſed, becauſe God is ſo; and they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him by Chriſt in his unchangeable holineſs and bleſſedneſs; ſee therefore, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God and his Unchangeableneſs in that unchangeableneſs, which Saints and Angels attain unto, aſcribing theirs wholly to his.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60044:64"/>
               <p n="4">4. Would we give God the glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs? Then let us live upon this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of his: The more we live upon the Unchangeableneſs of God, the more we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it, and give him the glory of it: Now we ſhould live upon it under a double notion. — 1. We ſhould live upon it, as the ſole cauſe of all our preſervation, expecting all from it, and aſcribing all to it; This God challenges from us in the very text; <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye are not conſumed,</hi> q. d. 'tis from my Unchangeableneſs that you are alive, that you are out of Hell, and 'tis my Unchangeableneſs that muſt keep you alive, and preſerve you for ever, and I expect you ſhould own it and live upon it accordingly: Our language ſhould be, I am alive, and why? Becauſe God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: I am out of Hell; and why? Becauſe God is unchangeable; yea, I hope I ſhall live, and that for ever; But why? Becauſe God is unchangeable: True, I am a changeable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and being left to my ſelf, I ſhall quickly forfeit, Life, Soul, Salvation, and all; yea, I am forfeiting all every day and hour by ſin; but God is an unchangeable God, he is for ever the ſame, his Counſel, his Covenant, his Love are all unchangeable, and therefore I do live, and ſhall live, yea, live eternally: Oh, this is ſo to live upon the Unchangeableneſs of God, as to give him the glory of that perfection of his. <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60044:65"/>— 2. We ſhould live upon the Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God as a ſweet Spring of Comfort and Refreſhment to us under all thoſe afflictive changes, which here in this World we meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: We here meet with many afflictive changes; <hi>Changes and War are upon us;</hi> but the Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of God is a ſweet Spring of Comfort and Refreſhment in all, and under all; and when we live upon it as ſuch, bearing up our Souls thereupon, then do we give this Attribute its proper glory. This is what is called for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever</hi> (that is, live, reſt, depend upon him: Why ſo?) <hi>for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength;</hi> the words are, the Rock of Ages, the Rock of this Age, the Rock of former Ages, the Rock of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to come, a Rock in all Ages, and the Rock of all Ages; that is to ſay, a firm, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able One; and being ſuch an one, he is, he muſt be the proper object of truſt, and unleſs we do truſt in him, and live upon him, as our life, we do not give him his proper glory: We ſhould, as it were, ſit down, and ſay, Well though my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate changes, yet God does not change, and ſo long all is well: Though my Friends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts change, my Friends turn Enemies, and my Comforts Croſses; yet God does not change, and ſo long all is well: yea, 'tis true, my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit changes, there is no fixedneſs, no ſtability in it, as to any thing that is good and gracious;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60044:65"/>yet however God changes not, he is alwayes the ſame, and I'le live on him; <hi>The Lord lives, and bleſſed be my Rock,</hi> (ſaies

               <p n="5">5. Would we give God the glory of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes? then let us labour to imitate him, and to be as like him herein, as poſſibly we can; let us labour, as much as poſſible, for an holy Unchangeablenes, a fixednes and ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in what is good, even here, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God: we caſt an honour (as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) upon them whom we imitate; for by our imitation of them, we acknowledge an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in them, which is all that honouring in the firſt Notion of it imports; ſure I am, the more like to God we covet to be, and the more we imitate him in this perfection of his, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to an holy evenneſs and ſtability in what is Good, the more do we honour him, and give him his proper glory: But this may poſſibly be ſpoken to in a Chapter by it ſelf in its proper place.

               <argument>
                  <p> God's Unchangeableneſs ſhould induce us to chooſe him for our God and Portion, and to take up the reſt and happineſs of our Souls in him, with arguments to quicken thereunto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Unchangeableneſs of God calls aloud upon us all to chooſe him for our God and Portion, and to take up the reſt and happineſs of our Souls in him, and not in the Creatures. The truth is, to chooſe God for our God and Portion, and to take up our reſt and happineſs in him, is what every diſcovery of God, in one or another excellency or perfection of his, does chalenge and call for at our hands: Does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf to be an holy God? This calls upon us to chooſe him for our God and Portion, and to get an intereſt in his Holineſs: Does God reveal himſelf to be a gracious God, a God of Grace and Love? This calls upon us to chooſe him for our God and Portion, and to get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Love: Doth he reveal himſelf to be a faithful God, a God that keepeth Covenant and Mercy? This calls upon us to chooſe him for our God and Portion, and to get an intereſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60044:66"/>in his Faithfulneſs: ſo here? Does God reveal himſelf to be an Unchangeable God? This calls upon us to chuſe him for our God and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to get an intereſt in his Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; taking up the reſt and happineſs of our Souls in him; and accordingly, O that we would look and live above changeable Creatures, taking up our reſt and happineſs in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God, which to do is even infinitely our ſafeſt and ſweeteſt courſe: for pray conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who or what will you chuſe for your Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wherein will you place the reſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your Souls, if not in the Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God? Sure I am, you have but God or the Creature to make choice of; Now what is the Creature to God? What is the changeable Creature to the unchangeable God? Alas! the one is infinitely ſhort of the other: God indeed is every way, and in all reſpects a moſt deſirable Good; He is an original Good, a full Good, a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Good, a ſatisfying Good, an unmixed Good, an all-ſufficient Good; and, which crowns all, an Unchangeable Good, a Good that never fades, never failes.
<hi>He is the Living God, and ſtedfaſt for ever,</hi> Dan. 6.26. The Creatures are all changeable and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: An Heathen could ſay,<note place="margin">Inter peritura vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Sen.</hi>

Look, as the changeableneſs of the Creatures, lowers and allays that good and ſweetneſs, that is in them; ſo the Unchangeableneſs of God does infinitely raiſe and commend that good and excellency, that is in him. Had the Creatures ten thouſand times more good and excellency in them than they have, yet this one conſideration, that they are changeable, were enough to damp all, and quaſh all; though the Creatures had never ſo much ſweetneſs and goodneſs in them, and though I had never ſo full, free, and ample injoyment of them; though the ſtreames ran ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo pleaſantly on each hand of me, yet this one thought, that all this is fading, and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and will laſt but for a ſeaſon, were enough to allay my joy, and even imbitter all to me: So on the other hand, though God be ſuch an infinite Ocean of Goodneſs, Sweetneſs, and <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60044:67"/>Bleſſedneſs, as he is; yet that which crowns all, is his Unchangeableneſs in all; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, 'tis not the whole of God could make us happy. Now ſhall the conſideration hereof induce you to chuſe him for your God and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take up your reſt and happineſs in him for ever? Poſſibly you have never yet cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen God to be your God and Portion, nor have you taken up the reſt and happineſs of your Souls in him; you have choſen the Creatures, you have choſen this World, you have choſen carnal, ſenſual things, and in theſe have you placed your reſt and happineſs; but as for God, he has hitherto been <hi>far from your Reins;</hi> you have centred in changeable Creatures, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Unchangeable God: But will you now change your Choice, and take up a new Reſt? Oh now let an Unchangeable God, not changeable Creatures, be your God and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your Reſt and Happineſs. O that the language of your Souls to God, might now be that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Lord, thou, and thou alone ſhall be my God, my Reſt, my Portion, my Happineſs, and my All for ever: Indeed, I had choſen the Creatures for my Portion and Happineſs, but now I renounce that choice, I'le have no more to do with changeable Creatures, the World was my happineſs, and I ſat down
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60044:68"/>with it, <hi>ſo fooliſh was I, and ignorant;</hi> but now I have done with the World, this flitting, fading, dying World, and thou Lord alone ſhall be my All for ever: Oh that you would indeed thus chuſe the Unchangeable God, and take up your reſt and happineſs in him this day: And you that have choſen him, and taken up your happineſs in him, make a new choice of him, and take up your reſt more purely and entirely in him; ſay over this Unchangeable One; <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 48.14. Oh, labour to get more above the Creatures, and live more in God, and upon God: The more purely and entirely you take up your reſt in God, the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will he be to you, and the more ſatisfaction will your ſouls find in him. Now to quicken you thus to chuſe God, and live upon him, and his Unchangeableneſs;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, what a changeable World we live in; we live in a changeable World, in a World that rings changes every day, many changes, and great changes; the truth is, This World is a very changeable world, and
'tis not long e're it will be changed once for all, the day is coming, when
<hi>all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved; the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a noiſe, the Earth ſhall melt with fervent heat,</hi> 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.11. and in the mean time the world is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its changes; and how great changes we may live to ſee, who knows? ſuch changes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60044:68"/>ſeem to be coming upon the world as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Unchangeable God will be able to bear us up under them. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25,
26. we read of <hi>diſtreſs of Nations which ſhall be upon the Earth, with perplexity; mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs upon the Earth:</hi> The ſum of which amounts to this, that there ſhall be ſuch changes, ſuch rendings, ſuch ſhakings, ſuch terrible convulſions and concuſſions wrought in the Nations of the World; ſuch deſolations ſhall be made, and ſuch terrible ſtorms of wrath and vengeance ſhall fall upon the World, as that men ſhall be even exanimated, and driven to their wits end, they ſhall fall under a <hi>deliquium Animi,</hi> a ſwooning of Spirit, they ſhall breath out their very Souls; or, they ſhall be filled with ſuch anguiſh, horror, and confuſion of Soul, as that they ſhall be ready to lay violent hands upon themſelves, and take away their own lives: and, my Beloved, ſhould we live to ſee ſuch things, how good will an Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God be? O Sirs! living in ſuch a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able World, who would not fix upon an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God, as a Man's Portion and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? Who would not get upon, yea into this
<hi>Rock of Ages?</hi> And how good, how ſweet will it be to have an Unchangeable God to retreat to, and ark in?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, what changeable things all our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60044:69"/>Creature-comforts and contentments are: As the World, wherein we live, is a changeable World, So all our Creature-comforts are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comforts; Should the World ſtand where it does, and as it does, without any ſuch changes as we have mentioned; yet our beſt Creature-comforts here are ſubject to change every day; and how ſoon we may ſay of one, or another, or all of them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſometimes did of his two ſons <hi>Joſeph</hi> &amp; <hi>Simeon, Gen.</hi> 42.36.
<hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not?</hi> How ſoon we may ſay, this and that Comfort is not, who can tell? I have now a Trade, to morrow, it may be, I ſhall have none: I have now an Eſtate, to morrow, it may be, I ſhall have none: I have now a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Habitation, to morrow, it may be, it will be in Aſhes: I have now my Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about me, my Husband, or my Wife lying pleaſantly in my Boſom, my Children like Olive branches round about my Table, to morrow, it may be, they will all ſleep in the Duſt, and go down to the Gates of the Grave, and I ſhall ſee them no more: Alas! theſe things <hi>are not,</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of Riches) ſuch is their change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, that they have ſcarce a being; Or, ſuppoſe theſe things ſhould ſtay with us, yet how ſoon may they be imbitter'd to us? How ſoon may the beſt of this Wine be turned into Wormwood? How ſoon may the ſweeteſt of theſe Comforts be changed into bitter Croſſes? <pb n="115" facs="tcp:60044:69"/>Sometimes, <hi>the deſire of our eyes is taken away from us with a ſtroke,</hi> (as God threatned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of old) that is, ſuddenly; and e're ever we are aware of it our deareſt, ſweeteſt, and moſt delightful Comforts are taken from us: At other times the deſire of our Eyes becomes the burthen of our Souls, our deareſt Comforts are imbittered to us; that which yeſterday was ſweet and pleaſant, to day poſſibly is bitter and burthenſom to us; that which to day is the joy of our hearts, to morrow it may be will be as a goad in our ſides, and as thorns in our eyes: O how ſoon many times do our moſt pleaſant Streams turn into waters of <hi>Marah</hi> to us! Now all on this ſide God being thus changeable, who would not reſt in Him, and his Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Oh Unchangeableneſs! Unchangeableneſs! this is to be found in God alone, and therefore let him alone be the Reſt and Portion of our Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, how near our laſt and great change is unto us: ſhould the World never wax old, nor admit of any change; and ſhould our Creature-comforts and contentments live and laſt for ever; yet we our ſelves muſt change, we are fading, dying, periſhing Creatures; we paſs under many changes, and great changes, and 'tis but a little while e're our laſt and great change will come: Death is our laſt and great change till the Reſurrection: So the Holy Ghoſt <pb n="116" facs="tcp:60044:70"/>by
<hi>Joh</hi> ſpeaks of it, <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. and this is a great change indeed, a change from Work to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from Time to Eternity; a change out of this World into another; from theſe Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Clay, to live in eternal Regions, either of Light or Darkneſs; and thus ſhall We all be changed: a few years, a few months, a few weeks, a few dayes, a few hours, yea, it may be, but a few moments more and we ſhall all be thus changed changed by Death out of Time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternity; and how much then are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make choice of, and take up our reſt in an Unchangeable God? Then, namely when we paſs under this change, to be ſure nothing but Unchangeableneſs will be of any avail to us, and this is to be found in God alone; him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we chuſe, and take up our reſt in. This very conſideration induced
<hi>David</hi> to make a freſh choice of God, and cleave more entirely to him, as his Reſt and Happineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5, 6, 7. <hi>Behold, O Lord, thou haſt made my dayes as an hand-breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee: Verily, every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſurely every man walketh in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſquietted in vain:</hi> Well, and what now? Why, ſayes he, <hi>And now Lord what wait I for? My hope is in thee.</hi> He ſaw his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and changeableneſs, as alſo the vanity and changeableneſs of all others, both Perſons, and Things; he ſaw both himſelf, and all others in <pb n="117" facs="tcp:60044:70"/>their very beſt ſtate to be not only vain, but even vanity it ſelf, ſubject to change every hour; in the ſight and ſenſe of which he cleaves to God, chuſes him, centers in him as his God, his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his All: <hi>Now Lord what wait I for? My hope is in thee,</hi> q. d. Now Lord, that I have ſeen my own vanity and changeableneſs, and the vanity and changeableneſs of others too, now I look to thee, I cleave to thee, I reſt in thee as my onely Good, Portion, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I have now done with the Streames, with the Creatures, and Creature-contentments, and I'le now bathe only in the Fountain, reſt wholly in thy ſelf, <hi>the Fountain of living Waters.</hi> And, my Beloved, did we dwell more in the conſideration of the nearneſs of our laſt and great change, we ſhould doubtleſs cleave more cloſely and entirely to the Unchangeable God, as our reſt and Portion: Our thus
<hi>numbering our dayes,</hi> deep and frequent conſideration of the ſhortneſs of our lives, and how ſoon we may be changed, would make us to
<hi>apply our hearts to</hi> this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to get an intereſt in the Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. O be much therefore in this Work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, that then, and not till then, ſhall we be happy indeed, when we come to look and live above changeable Creatures upon an Unchangeable God. 'Tis happineſs, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that is the great intereſt of Souls, and <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60044:71"/>'tis happineſs we all deſire and purſue after; now then are we happy indeed, and not till then, when we get above the Creatures, and take up our reſt in the Unchangeable God. Pray, Sirs, let us conſider things a little; Suppoſe you had this whold World at will, and might injoy as much of the Creature as your Souls could wiſh; ſuppoſe you could all your dayes live in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of all earthly Delights, and ſwim chin-deep in the Streams of all Creature-contentments; yet what were all this? Alas! it would not make up one dram of true happineſs; your happineſs muſt be in God ſtill: Mind how the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks as to this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy is the People that is in ſuch a caſe; yea, happy is that Poople whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> In what caſe was this? Why, a caſe of outward proſperity, a caſe of enjoying an afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all outward Creature-contentments; for of theſe he had ſpoken before. But <hi>David,</hi> is this really your judgment, and do you give it us for a divine Truth, that theſe things make men happy? No (ſayes he) I rather herein tell you what the Worlds judgments is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they look upon happineſs to conſiſt; They think thoſe of all others to be the happieſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who enjoy moſt of this World, moſt eaſe, moſt pleaſure, moſt of Creature-comforts: But (ſayes he) I am of another mind, I account them the happy People, who have the Lord for their God, that is, who have a Covenant-relation to, <pb n="119" facs="tcp:60044:71"/>and intereſt in the bleſſed God; 'tis God, not the Creature, the enjoyment of whom makes happy.

What ſhall I ſay? God is his own <pb n="120" facs="tcp:60044:72"/>happineſs, he is eternally bleſſed in and with himſelf, (as has been before declared) and he is the happineſs of his Creatures, both Saints and Angels; and when God makes his People, his Saints and Servants, perfectly happy, which he never does till he takes them to Heaven, he then takes them from all their Creature-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and he admits and receives them into the full and ſingle enjoyment of himſelf. 'Twere eaſie to ſhew that nothing ſhort of God, and his unchangeableneſs, can poſſibly make happy; and accordingly that we ſhall never be happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, till we learn to carry our happineſs above the road of Creatures, and place it wholly and intirely in God: But I muſt not run out too far here. Oh, my Beloved, that man is certainly happieſt, whoſe heart and life are holieſt, and whoſe communion with God is fulleſt; he that enjoyes moſt of God, whether he enjoys much or little of the Creature, he it is that is moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.

               <p n="5">5. Conſider, that God freely offers himſelf as an Unchangeable Good, in his Covenant to you. You know how he ſpeaks to ſinners, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Come unto me, and I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with you.</hi> And pray what is this Covenant? Why, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> that you know is the grand Promiſe of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. In the Covenant God offers himſelf to ſinners in all his glorious Excellencies and Perfections: his language therein to them is, Come Souls, ſee what a God I am, how great, how good, how rich, how glorious, ſee what treaſures of light and life, of love and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there are in me; and loe! I am willing to be yours, your God, your Friend, your Father, your Portion, your Happineſs, your All for ever: Look, what ever I am, that I will be to you; and whatever I can do, that I will do for you. <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60044:73"/>Thus he offers himſelf in all his glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Perfections to you, and as in all, ſo particularly in his Unchangeableneſs; Come, ſayes he, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> and as ſuch an one do I tender my ſelf to you, my Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs ſhall be the Rock of your Reſt, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of my Nature, my Counſel, my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, my Love, is a ſure footing for your Faith, and a firm Foundation for your Comfort: While I am, I will be Life and Bleſſedneſs to you; I'le be a never-failing Fountain of Peace, Joy, &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to you: <hi>I am the Firſt and the Laſt, He who was, and is, and is to come;</hi> and as ſuch I will be yours for ever; and when the World, and all that is therein ſhall be burnt up, I wil be a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Portion for you; when the whole World is like a tumbling Ocean round about you, I'le be a <hi>Rock of Ages</hi> to you; and be not afraid of me, I am a God of Grace and Love: 'Tis true, I am
<hi>the Great and High God,</hi> but my Highneſs ſhall ſtoop, and my greatneſs ſhall condeſcend to you; yea, and nothing ſhall ſtand between you and me, no ſin, no vileneſs, no unworthineſs of yours; I know you are poor, vile, ſinful worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs worms, infinitely unworthy of me; I know your ſins are many, and the diſtance between me and you is great; but all this ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from an intereſt in Me, and my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs, if you will take hold of my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, chuſe me for your God and Portion, <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60044:73"/>and take up the reſt and happineſs of your Souls in me. Thus God reveals and offers himſelf in his Covenant to us; and does he thus offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Covenant to us; and ſhall we not chuſe him for our God and Portion? ſhall we ſtick in the Creature ſtill and reject the offer God makes of himſelf to us? God forbid! Oh let us now chuſe this Unchangeable God, and let him be our Reſt, our Portion, our Happineſs and our All for ever. Let us reaſon matters a little in our own Souls; the World that is fall of changes, all my Creature-comforts and Contentments they are ſubject to change, I am not ſure of them one moment, my own laſt and great change is near at hand, I know not how ſoon 'twill come upon me, nothing but the Unchangeable God can make me happy; and he freely offers himſelf in his Covenant to me; and ſhall I yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, neglect him? ſhall I cleave to the Creature, and not to this Unchangeable God? by no means; He, not the fading, oying, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be my Portion and my Happineſs for ever. Or, if all this does not do, than once more,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, how ſad and dreadful a thing it will be to have the Unchangeableneſs of God againſt you. This is a ſure rule, that unleſs we make God ours by chuſing of him, and cloſing in his Covenant with him, as our God and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he and all his Attributes will at laſt be found againſt us, againſt us to deſtroy us, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60044:74"/>make us miſerable for ever: if we make not God's Unchangeableneſs ours, and ingage it not for us, by chuſing him as unchangeable, his Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs will ſtand for ever ingaged againſt us; and Oh how ſad will that be? 'Tis ſad to have any Attribute of God againſt a Man; but to have his Unchangeableneſs againſt us how ſad is that? O for a Man to have God for his eternal Enemy, God eternally and Unchangeably ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, this is enough to render him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly and unchangeably miſerable. Again, therefore let me call upon you to look and live above changeable Creatures, and to chuſe, reſt in, and live upon the Unchangeable God, as your God and Portion; look upon him in Chriſt, in whom you will find him infinitely full of love and ſweetneſs, in whom you will find him Love it ſelf, <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. and accordingly let your ſouls chuſe him, and cleave to him, as yours for ever.</p>

               <p n="1">1. God being Unchangeable, his Glory ſhall live, and in due time ſhine forth conſpicuouſly before all; for this ſee
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. <hi>I am the Lord, I am Jehovah, I am he who was, and is, and is to come,</hi> the Unchangeable God; Well, and what <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60044:78"/>then? Why, <hi>My Glory will I not give to another, nor my Praiſe to Graven Images;</hi> my Glory ſhall not die but live, my Glory ſhall not be alwayes veiled and eclipſed; but it ſhall ſhine forth in perfect luſtre and ſplendor. One of the great burthens, that lies upon the People of God, is, the ſufferings of his Name and Glory: <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of them that reproached thee are fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me,</hi> (ſayes <hi>David</hi>)
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9.

You know how God ſpeaks in reference to the Glory of his Name in anſwer to Chriſt's Prayer,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Father glorifie thy Name</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) and what anſwer does the Father give him? <hi>I have glorified it, and I will glorifie it again;</hi> q.d.

               <p n="2">2. God being Unchangeable, his Church ſhall be preſerved and delivered, preſerved under, and in due time delivered out of all her troubles and afflictions; and what a ſweet thing is that?

O how admirably has God wrought for them, both in ſupporting, and delivering of them? and certainly what he has done, that he can and will do for them again, as the caſe ſhall require: God is Unchangeable, <hi>His Hand is not ſhortned, that he cannot ſave; nor his Ear grown heavy, that he cannot hear,</hi> Iſa. 59.1. God being Unchangeable, he is as tender of, and careful for, his Church and People, as ever he was; being Unchangeable, he is every way the ſame to his People now, as he was formerly; the ſame in his Love to them, his Jealouſie for them, his Sympathy with them, &amp; his Intereſt in them; he ſtands in the ſame Covenant-Relation to them, that ever he did; he is their King, their Head, their Husband, their Friend, their Father, their Shepherd now, as well as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60044:79"/>and he is every way as able to help them, and accordingly will ſupport, and in due time deliver them, and this Faith ſees, and reſts aſſured of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9,
10, 11, 12. <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O Arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancients dayes, in the Generations of old; Art thou not it that hath cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wounded the Dragon? Art thou not it which hath dryed the Sea, the Waters of the great Deep, that hath made the depths of the Sea a way for the ranſomed to paſt over?</hi> &amp;c. So again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1.9, 10. <hi>But we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God who raiſeth the dead, who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us:</hi> Mark, Faith you ſee, argues from what God has done, to what he will do for his poor Church and People; And what bottom or ground has it ſo to do, but his Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Let Sion therefore, the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God take heed of that language, which ſhe ſpake of old, Iſa. 49.14. <hi>Sion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me:</hi> And as <hi>Jacob</hi> elſewhere, <hi>My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over by my God;</hi> for God muſt change, e're this can be: True, God may permit his Church to be ſorely afflicted, as at this day; but 'tis but to illuſtrate his own Glory the more in Her ſupport and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:60044:80"/>
               <p n="3">3. God being Unchangeable, his Enemies ſhall be deſtroyed, they ſhall all die and periſh; I mean his incorrigible, implacable Enemies, who will not ſtoop to the Scepter of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. God may, and ſometimes does permit his and his Peoples Enemies to <hi>practiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,</hi> and that for a long time together, he lets them alone in their ſins and oppoſitions againſt both himſelf and them; yea, he even
<hi>fills their belly with his hid Treaſure,</hi> (as you have it)
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. he lets them injoy ſome of the beſt of outward Comforts and contentments, and that in great fulneſs, which oftentimes proves a great burthen and temptation to his poor afflicted People, ſuch as is ready even to ſink and bear them down: So it was with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>beg.</hi> and 'tis ſo many times with us; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God is Unchangeable, and being Unchangeable, though he may permit his and his Peoples Enemies to <hi>practiſe and proſper</hi> for a time, yet not alwayes; no, they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and that with a great deſtruction: Pray obſerve how things iſſued at laſt in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pſalm,

Still you ſee, though God permit his and his Peoples Enemies to proſper for a time, yet at laſt they are deſtroyed, and as ſure as God is Unchangeable, they ſhall be deſtroyed. Pray compare but my Text with the verſe immediately preceeding, Mal. 3.5, 6. <hi>I will come near to you to judgment,</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the Sorcerers, and againſt the Adulterers, and againſt falſe Swearers, and againſt all that oppreſs the Hireling in his Wages, the Widow and the Fatherleſs, and that fear not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> q.d. I'le ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and terribly deſtroy all mine Enemies, all that go on in their ſinings againſt me: But how ſhall we be aſſured of this? He tells you in the next words, for <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> q.d. as ſure as I am God and Unchangeable, they ſhall be deſtroyed. O Sirs, though God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his and his Peoples Enemies to proſper for <pb n="138" facs="tcp:60044:81"/>a time, yet he alwayes certainly deſtroys them in the concluſion, and he will do ſo ſtill, becauſe he is Unchangeable: God is every way the ſame that ever he was, the ſame in Holineſs, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, Juſtice, Power, that ever he was; He is as holy now as ever he was, and ſo does hate ſin as much, as ever he did; he is as juſt now, as ever he was, and ſo as ready and propenſe to take vengeance as ever; he is as jealous now, as jealous for his Name, Worſhip, Goſpel, and People, as ever he was, and ſo will as little bear with the oppoſers and abuſers of them; he is as wiſe and powerful now, as ever, and ſo as able to deal with his Enemies: 'Tis a great Scripture that <hi>Job</hi> 9.4. <hi>He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength; Who ever hardened himſelf againſt him and proſpered.</hi> O never any yet did, and never any ſhall: No, but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. <hi>He will wound the head of his Enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes:</hi> Oh that all the Enemies of God and his People, and all rebellious impenitent ones, would lay this to heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God being Unchangeable, the purpoſes and promiſes of his Grace to his Church and People ſhall certainly be accompliſht. God's Heart, my Beloved, has been full of counſels and purpoſes of Love towards his People from all eternity, and he has alſo made many bleſſed Promiſes to them, <hi>Promiſes</hi> that are <hi>exceeding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60044:81"/>great and pretious,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. becauſe full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and pretious things: Greatneſs and pretiouſneſs do not often meet together; many things are great, but then they are not pretious; and many things are pretious, but then they are not great; but in the promiſes of God to his Church and People, greatneſs and pretiouſneſs do meet: Now look what-ever purpoſes God has had in his Heart, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever promiſes he has made in this Word to his People, they ſhall all be accompliſht, becauſe he is an Unchangeable God, he is the ſame now, that he was when he took up thoſe purpoſes, and made thoſe promiſes, and therefore will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly make them all good in the due ſeaſon; and ſo much he tells us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.9, 10, 11. <hi>I am God,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and there is none elſe; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times, the things that are not yet done, ſaying, My Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure; I have ſpoken, and I'le bring it to paſs; I have purpoſed it, I alſo will do it:</hi> Mark, firſt, he aſſerts his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Unchangeableneſs, and then he tells you all his pleaſure ſhall ſtand, and be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht. God being Unchangeable (Firſt) None can turn him, or make him alter his mind; <hi>Job</hi> 23.13, 14. <hi>He is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his Soul deſiveth even that he doth; for he performeth the thing that is appointed for <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60044:82"/>me,</hi> &amp;c. The wiſeſt and moſt reſolved among men may poſſibly be wrought upon, and brought over from what they purpoſed; but 'tis not ſo with God. (Secondly) None can hinder him from, or in his making good his purpoſes and promiſes, <hi>Iſa</hi> 43.13. <hi>Before the day was, I am he, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who ſhall let it?</hi> Poor Soul, whoever thou art, that art one of the Lord's People, look back to the eternal counſels and purpoſes of his Love towards thee, and thou wilt find them a great Deep, a Fountain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Sweetneſs; in them thou wilt ſee heaps of Love, and treaſures of Grace; and then turn thine eye to the promiſes of his Covenant, which thou wilt find unexpreſſibly ſweet, and exactly ſuitable to thy condition, to all thy wants, and then know aſſuredly that the whole, both of the one and the other, ſhall be accompliſht to thee in due ſeaſon: 'Tis true indeed, his Counſels may ſeem to us to be fruſtrated, and his Promiſes may for a time be deferred, and delayed, in ſo much that our haſty unbelieving hearts may be ready to conclude, that they will never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht; ſaying with the
<hi>Pſalmiſt, Does his Promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> Pſal. 77.8. But, Soul, wait a while, and they ſhall all be made good to a tittle. Has he promiſed to pardon thee, to cleanſe thee, to give thee a new Heart, and a new Spirit, to write his Law in thine Heart? <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60044:82"/>Has he promiſed to ſave thee, and lodg thee at laſt in his own Boſom? then know it ſhall all be accompliſht: Oh how ſweet is this! Oh to faſten upon a Promiſe, and ſee it ſure to be made good, as in God's Unchangeableneſs we may; there we may ſee all as ſure, as if 'twere already accompliſht. Oh what ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does this afford? what unexpreſſible ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will this give unto a Soul?</p>
               <p n="5">5. God being Unchangeable, the Saints are unchangeably happy, and have a bleſſed Aſſylum to flee unto under all thoſe changes and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, that may at any time come upon them. Pray mark, my Beloved, God is the Saints God and Portion: and in him does their happineſs lye; He therefore being Unchangeable, they have an Unchangeable Happineſs, they are an happy People, and they will be unchangeably ſo. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations;</hi> and what then? <hi>Bleſſed is the Nation whoſe God is the Lord, and the People whom he hath choſen for his own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Pſal. 33.11, 12. The Saints (as one well obſerves) are in all reſpects a bleſſed People, they are bleſſed in the pardon of their ſins:
<hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven, Pſal.</hi> 32.1. They are bleſſed in regard of the diſpoſition of their Souls:
<hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, bleſſed are the Meek, bleſsed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 5.3, 4, 6.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60044:83"/>They are bleſſed in their Obedience and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God: <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> Pſal. 119.1. They are bleſſed in their hopes and expectations: <hi>Bleſſed are they that wait for God,</hi> Iſa. 30.18. Thus they are every way, and in all reſpects a bleſſed People; but here lies the perfection and top-glory of their bleſſedneſs, and what indeed comprehends all the reſt in it, namely, that the Unchangeable God is their God and Portion: <hi>Happy is the People whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144.15. Oh, this ſpeaks them to be infinitely and unchangeably happy, and accordingly they ſhould live upon him, and that under all their ſtreights and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Oh Sirs, what is there that this will not ſupport and comfort you under? Do your Friends and Comforts here change? however God your beſt Friend and Comfort changes not, and that is enough. Do times and ſeaſons change, and that for the worſe, from ſun-ſhine to ſtorms? Well, however Soul, thy God changes not, and that is enough to ſweeten all. Doſt thou thy ſelf change? <hi>changes and war are upon thee,</hi> and which is the worſt of it, thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit changes, it will not keep even with God one hour; well ſtill thy God changes not, and that is enough. Do new temptations ariſe, and old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptions break out a new? Does guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and recur upon thee? be it ſo, yet thy God is Unchangeable, and ſo can and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60044:83"/>and ſuccour thee now as well as formerly, and that is enough. Yea, do God's diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons change towards thee? he did ſmile, now he frowns; he did lift up, now he caſts down; the light of his Countenance did ſhine brightly upon thee, now 'tis veild &amp; clouded: Well, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, thy God himſelf changes not; his Heart, his Counſel, his Covenant, his Love are ſtill the ſame towards thee that ever they were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the diſpenſation be changed. Oh, this one word, God is Mine, and he is Unchangeable, has infinite ſweetneſs in it, and it ſpeakes me to be infinitely and unchangeably happy. Oh you that are the People of God, labour to ſee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in this happineſs of yours: Which that you may the better do, let me add onely two ſhort Words to this, and I will ſhut up the whole Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that as your God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo you are unchangeably intereſted in him. This Unchangeable God is unchangeably your God; what though God be unchangeable (may ſome poor Soul ſay) what will that avail me? my intereſt in him I fear will change, and fail, there will ſhortly be an end of that; No Soul, the Unchangeable God being indeed thine, he is thine for ever: ſo the Church, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 48.14. O Soul, thou, through infinite, free, and rich Grace, haſt a Covenant-intereſt in and relation to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable

I ſhall here onely add a ſaying or two of <hi>Auſtin; The chief good,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>which is God,</hi>

O Saints! the Unchangeable God is yours, and ſome commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you have with him here in the waies of his Grace, which is ſweet and happy; but after you have injoyed him in the waies of his Grace a while here, you ſhall be taken to the Unchangeable injoyment of him in his Glory Above, which will be infinitely more ſweet and <pb n="146" facs="tcp:60044:85"/>happy; your injoyment of him here is low and remote, as well as changeable, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; but your injoyment of him Above will be full, cloſe, and Unchangeable: here you have now and then a gracious viſit from him; he viſits you in this Duty, and that Ordinance, in this Mercy, and in that Affliction; but Oh how ſhort many times are thoſe viſits of his? Alas! he is gone again in a moment: but after a while you ſhall injoy him in his Glory, and there you ſhall not have a ſhort viſit now and then onely, but his conſtant preſence for ever: <hi>We ſhall be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17. Oh bleſſed Souls! there he will unchangeably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in you, unchangeably ſhine upon you, unchangeably communicate himſelf in his Grace and Glory to you; Oh how ſweet and bleſſed will this be!

<hi>David</hi> calls upon his Soul to return unto. The ſum of the words, and of our intendment from them, laid down in one general Poſition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is the great happineſs of the Saints, that howbeit they meet with many ſore troubles and afflictions here in this World; yea, though
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60044:87"/>they meet with little elſe but trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, yet there is a Reſt to come for them, a ſweet Reſt, a bleſſed Reſt, a glorious Reſt, a Reſt not lyable to either decay or diſturbance for ever: So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us <hi>Heb,</hi> 4.9. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a Reſt to the People of God:</hi> Nor is this all their happineſs; for, not only does there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Reſt for them hereafter, but there is alſo a Reſt, a ſweet Reſt, a bleſſed Reſt, which they do, or may attain unto here; a Reſt even in the midſt of all thoſe troubles, which here they are expoſed unto: and bleſſed be God for this Reſt; Reſt is ſweet, but Reſt in trouble, Reſt in the midſt of many and ſore troubles; Oh how ſweet, how glorious is this! Now this is the Reſt which I would a little contemplate and ſpeak unto, as the proper ſubject of theſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Return unto thy Reſt, O my Soul:</hi> which words are <hi>David's</hi> Call or Command to his Soul, to return unto its Reſt: And the only thing to be enquired into for the clearing of them, and therein for the making way to what we intend from them, is, what this Reſt is which <hi>David</hi> here calls upon his Soul to return unto; and I find it expounded two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some expound it of God himſelf, God in Chriſt, who indeed is the Reſt, as well as the Refuge of his People: God is <hi>centrum quietati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum</hi> (as the Schooles ſpeak) the proper quieting,

               <p n="2">2. Others expound it of a quiet, ſerene, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, well-compoſed frame and poſture of Soul; and thus <hi>Calvin</hi> and others expound it:<note place="margin">Quod interpretes quinam ſub nomine quietis Deum intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt, coactum eſt, potius enim pro tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillo &amp; bene compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito animi statu ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur. <hi>Calv.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt what is it for a Soul to be at Reſt in God, or to live in a poſture of Reſt in God? In in general, 'tis for a Soul to ſit down ſatisfied with what God does as beſt, and with what God is, as all; and ſo this Reſt of the Soul in God lies in two things. (Firſt) In a free and chearful ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. (Secondly) In a full and ample ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in and with the Divine Preſence and Fulneſs: And Oh the Beauty, the ſweetneſs, the ami ableneſs, that both theſe carry in them! a little of each.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis to ſit down ſatisfied with what God doth as beſt, and ſo it lies in a free and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Will and Providence of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: the Soul, through Grace, gets right apprehenſions of God's Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning him; he looks upon the Will of God to be a Sovereign, a Righteous, a Wiſe, <pb n="155" facs="tcp:60044:89"/>and a Good Will; and hereupon he ſits down ſatisfied with it, whatever it does with him, whatever it allots and orders out concerning him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul looks upon the Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God concerning him to be a Sovereign Will and Providence; a will and Providence which does, which may do with him whatever it pleaſes, and ſo he acquieſces in it. <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> (ſaid good old <hi>Ely</hi>)
<hi>let him doe what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18.

It was a dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible meſſage which <hi>Samuel</hi> told him from the Lord; but ſo dreadful and terrible as it was, yet having his eye upon the Sovereignty of God, he freely acquieſces. Suitable whereunto is the Obſervation of a Learned Man upon this place;<note place="margin">Magnam exprimit patientiam, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numque cum volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate divina conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum; non expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit cum Deo, ſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer concordavit. <hi>Mendoz.</hi>

                  <hi>Eli</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>in theſe words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes great patience, and a great conſent or agreement with the Divine Will; he did not expoſtulate with God, but humbly complyed and compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him.</hi> God, my Beloved, has an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereignty over us all, and may do with us <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60044:90"/>as he pleaſes: 'Tis what he challenges to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his prerogative; <hi>All Souls are mine,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. mine to do with them, to diſpoſe of them, as I will: And you know, how God aſſerts this his Sovereignty in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6.0 <hi>Houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you, as this Potter</hi> (ſaies the Lord) <hi>Behold, as the Clay is in the Potters hand, ſo are ye in my hand, O Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Pray mark, he had before, at <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. ſhewn them how the Potter dealt by the Clay, and what an abſolute power he had over it, making it a Veſſel, and marring it again, as he pleaſed; and now here, in <hi>v.</hi>6. ſayes he,
<hi>Cannot I do with you as this Potter</hi> doth with his Clay? I can,
<hi>behold as the Clay is in the hand of the Potter, ſo are ye in mine hand; i.e.</hi> I have an abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over you, to do with you, and diſpoſe of you, as I ſee good, and I may make or mar you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wheel of my Providence, as I pleaſe: And you know how God by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues in that greateſt of caſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Hath not thr Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump to make one Veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> In which words God aſſerts his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſovereignty to diſpoſe of all men as to their eternal Eſtates, as he pleaſes: Thus he has an abſolute Sovereignty over all: Now the Holy Soul apprehending this Sovereignty in God, falls under the awe and dread of it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly acquieſces in his Will, whatever it be.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60044:90"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul looks upon the Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God concerning him to be an Holy and Righteous, as well as a Sovereign Will and Providence, and upon that account alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſces therein. <hi>The Lord is righteous,</hi> (ſaid the Church) <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled againſt his Commandment,</hi> q.d. 'Tis true, my ſorrow is great, and mine affliction heavy; but God is juſt and holy in it, 'tis no more than, nor in truth ſo much as, my ſins have deſerved: Indeed, God's dealings with Her were very terrible and amazing, but yet, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Righteouſneſs of God in them, She ſubmits to him under all: So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of Face:</hi> They ſaw the Righteouſneſs of God in his dealings with them, and ſo were at Reſt in his Will. <hi>God is Righteous</hi> (the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us) <hi>in all his Wayes, and Holy in all his Works,</hi> and <hi>he is a juſt Lord that doth,</hi> that can do, no wrong, <hi>no iniquity, Zeph.</hi> 3.5. Now the Holy Soul gets a ſight of this, and is awed with the ſenſe thereof, and accordingly, acquieſces in God's Will: True (ſayes he) this and that is ſharp, it ſmarts ſorely, it runs croſs to my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appetite, to my ſenſe and reaſon; but I am ſure God is holy and juſt in all, I have deſerved all and more at his hands; and in the ſenſe of this he acquieſces in his Will, and is ſatisfied with his Dealings.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60044:91"/>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul looks upon the Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God concerning him to be a Wiſe, as well as an Holy Will and Providence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo bows to it, and acquieſces in it. God, my Beloved, is
<hi>the only Wiſe</hi> God, and all his Works are done in Wiſdom, his Will is a wiſe Will, a Will guided and ordered by Counſel; he <hi>works all things according to the Counſel of his own Will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. God is never out in what he does, but dos all as becomes an only and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe God; which the holy Soul getting a ſight and ſenſe of, he freely acquieſces in whatever the will of God is concerning him, and Reſts fully ſatisfied with what God does: In <hi>Job</hi> 1.22. we read <hi>that in all this Job ſinned not, neither charged he God fooliſhly: In all this,</hi> that is, in all his tryals and afflictions, though many, though great, (<hi>in all this Job ſinned not, neither charged he God fooliſhly;</hi> or (as you have it in the Margent of ſome of your Bibles) <hi>he did not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute folly to God;</hi> he ſinned not by attributing of folly to God; but he worſhipped and adored the Divine Wiſdom, the Wiſdom of God in all his dealings with him; He acquitted God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of folly, and bowed to the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thereof, and was ſatisfied with all as beſt for him: All this, ſayes the Holy Soul, is the Work of a Wiſe Will, regulated by Counſel; true, all runs croſs to my Will and my outward Intereſt, but
'tis all ballanced by infinite Wiſdom, and I <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60044:91"/>am ſatisfied therewith: thus he is at Reſt in God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul looks upon the Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God concerning him to be a Good, as well as a Wiſe Will and Providence, and thus alſo acquieſces in it. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>all the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and truth to ſuch as keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. By the <hi>Paths</hi> of the Lord here we are to underſtand his Providences; Now (ſaies he) theſe are <hi>all Mercy and Truth</hi> to his People; Not ſome, but <hi>all</hi> of them, even the hardeſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt, the moſt dark, terrible, and killing of them, they are <hi>all Mercy and Truth,</hi> Mercy it ſelf, and Truth it ſelf: whatever the Will and Providence of God brings forth, yet to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there is love in all, Goodneſs in all, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all, and the Holy Soul, getting a ſight hereof, ſweetly acquieſces, and is at Reſt in whatever God does; So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi> See <hi>Hezekiah alſo, Iſa.</hi> 39.8. <hi>Good</hi> (ſaies he to
<hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>is the word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi>
'Twas a ſharp and a ſevere Word or Meſsage, which God by
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſent him, as you may ſee in the precedent verſes; but yet he ſaw goodneſs in all, and kindneſs in all, and accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced therein: Truly there is love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all God's dealings with his People, and <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60044:92"/>the Holy Soul ſeeing it, his language is, whether God fills or empties, whether he gives or takes away, whether he lifts up or caſts down, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he kills or makes alive; yet there is love in all, goodneſs in all, and 'tis beſt for me: God chuſes for me, and diſpoſes of me better than I could for my ſelf, and I am ſatisfied with what he does. Thus the Soul gets right apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Will and Providence of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and hereupon is ſweetly ſatisfied, and ſits down at Reſt in God in the midſt of all he does to him or with him. True, God may deal ſomewhat ſeverely with him, he may
<hi>break him with breach upon breach,</hi> as he did <hi>Job:</hi> he may
<hi>cauſe all his Waves and his Billows to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him,</hi> as he dealt with <hi>David;</hi> but ſtill the Soul looks upon all to be Holy, Juſt, and Good, and no other than what God in his Sovereignty may do; and ſo he Reſts ſatisfied therewith, he Reſts content in God and his Will under all, there are no diſquietments or perplexities of Spirit, no diſtractions or diſcompoſures of Soul; no frettings, no tumults, no murmurings, no riſings of heart againſt God, or his Will, but there is a ſweet calm, ſerenity, and Reſt in the Soul, he is in a ſedate, ſerene poſture in his God; and this Reſt in God the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him that proſpereth in the way:</hi> Reſting in God is here oppoſed to <pb n="161" facs="tcp:60044:92"/>fretting, and ſo muſt note a quiet, ſedate, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed Spirit in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis for a Soul to ſit down ſatisfied with what God is, as all, and ſo it lies in a full and ample ſatisfaction, in, and with the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and fulneſs: 'Tis for a Soul to take up, in, and with the bleſſed God, as his only and all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Portion and happineſs for ever. God, my Beloved, is an All-ſufficient God, he aſſerts his own All-ſufficiency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God all-ſufficient,</hi> (ſaies he to <hi>Abraham</hi>) q. d. I am infinitely ſufficient for my ſelf, and I am infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient for thee and all my People, to make the one and the other happy for ever. God is an inexhauſtible Fountain of Light, Life, Love, Bleſſedneſs, Perfection and Glory; there is all good in God, and he that has God has all. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to inherit all things:</hi> And how ſo? <hi>I will be his God,</hi> Rev. 21.7. He has all good, all happineſs in him, and in him we may find all as in its Fountain-fulneſs and purity. Now the Soul, ſeeing God to be ſuch a God, and withal looking upon him as his God in Covenant, ſits down ſatisfied with him alone, ſaying, I have enough, I have all, and ſo is at Reſt in him, whether he has much or little, any thing or nothing of this worlds good; whether the ſtreams run high or low with him, yet here is a a Fountain of infinite ſweetneſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he drinks there, and ſatisfies himſelf <pb n="162" facs="tcp:60044:93"/>there; he ſees the Fountain is ſo full, that he needs not the ſtreams to make him happy, and accordingly ſits down ſatisfied therewith, and is at Reſt: Thus <hi>David's</hi> Soul was at Reſt in God, <hi>Pſ l.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>the Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance, and of my Cup:</hi> Well, and what then? Why he ſits down at Reſt in him, <hi>the lines</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>are fallen to me in pleaſant places yea, I have a goodly heritage;</hi> I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, enough for delight, and enough for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; I have as much as my Soul can wiſh or deſire; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>As for me, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Face in Righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied, when I awake, with thy likeneſs;</hi> in the verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding he had ſpoken of ſome whoſe portion and happineſs is in this World; well, and pray
<hi>David</hi> where and in what is your Portion, your happineſs? My Portion is in God, and my Happineſs is in God, (ſaies he) in the ſight of God, and in the likeneſs of God; let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take up their Reſt, Portion and Happineſs where and in what they will, God is my Reſt, my Portion, my Happineſs, my All for ever: <hi>as for me I will behold,</hi> &amp;c. Again,
<hi>the Lord lives,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>and bleſſed be my Rock, Pſal.</hi> 18.46. q. d. ſuch and ſuch Comforts are dead and gone,
<hi>they are not,</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpake of his ſons) well, but however God lives ſtill, I have a living God, and he is a living Happineſs, and that's enough. So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my Houſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60044:93"/>be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure, and this is all my Salvation, and all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> q. d. God is my God by Covenant, and here is my happineſs, even all that my Soul can wiſh, and accordingly he is at Reſt in his God: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee: my heart and my fleſh faileth, but God is the Rock of my heart, and my Portion for ever.</hi> How dark ſoever things lookt with him, yet he, looking to his God, was ſatisfied and at Reſt in him, and with him, as infinitely enough for him. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the ſame courſe, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall Fruit be in the Vines; the labour of the Olive ſhall fail,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation:</hi> He ſuppoſes the worſt that could come, and yet ſtill reſolves to be at Reſt in God, and that God alone ſhall be enough for him, when all other things fail. Thus the holy Soul ſits down ſatisſied with God alone, ſetting God, and an intereſt in God, over and againſt all his Wants, Loſſes, Burthens, Difficulties, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as one infinitely able to relieve and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him under all; his language to God is, Lord, let others take the Word, and the good things thereof, give me thy Self, and I have enough; run out to broken Ciſterns who will, let me have a <pb n="164" facs="tcp:60044:94"/>free recourſe unto the Fountain, and I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; 'tis true, the Tyde of Creature-comforts runs low with me, and on the other hand, the Waves and Surges of Affliction riſe high; but God is all-ſufficient, and I have enough in him; he ſees a little of that glorious Fullneſs, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bleſsedneſs that is in God, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſings an holy Requiem unto himſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt Goods, Light, Life, Love, Bleſſedneſs, Salvation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough laid up for thee for many dayes, yea for the dayes of Eternity, take thine eaſe, ſit down ſatisfied in and with thy God alone; had'ſt thou ten thouſand Worlds, without him thou had'ſt nothing, but in him thou haſt all, Reſt thou therefore in him. Thus you ſee what 'tis for a Soul to be at Reſt in God, and when he may be ſaid to be at Reſt in him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Obligation the Saints are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to live at Reſt in God, is this, The bleſſed God hath freely made over himſelf in his Covenant to them, and that in all his glorious Riches and Fulneſs, that in him their Souls might be at Reſt: He hath given himſelf to them, as their Reſt and Portion; and is not this a mighty Obligation in the caſe? God, my Beloved, in the Covenant of his Love, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60044:95"/>hath freely given and made over himſelf to his People in all his Riches and Fulneſs, in all his Excellencies and Perfections, to be uſed, poſſeſt, and injoyed by them, as an All-ſufficient Reſt, Portion and Happineſs for ever: This is evident in the very tenour of the Covenant, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you have a formal Mention or Record of the Covenant in Scripture, this is put in, <hi>I will be your God:</hi> You have three great and ſolemn mentions of the Covenant in Scripture, and in all of them this is in: one is <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. another is
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. and the third is <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12.

<hi>Caput Faederis,</hi> the Head or Top of the Covenant; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima Faederis</hi> (as another) the Soul of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>Subſtantia Foederis</hi> (as another) the Life and Subſtance of the Covenant: And indeed when God ſaies to a Soul, I'le be thy God, he does therein ſay, I'le Pardon thee, I'le cleanſe <pb n="167" facs="tcp:60044:95"/>thee, I'le teach thee, I'le ſave thee, I'le make thee happy for ever: For God to be our God, is for God to be and communicate all good to us, that a God can communicate, and Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; 'tis for God to love us, to bleſs us, to care for us, to make us happy for ever; 'tis for God, to give us eternal Life, to be a Friend, a Father, an Husband, and a Saviour to us. <hi>'Tis</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſomewhere expounds it) <hi>for God to make over himſelf in all his Excellencies, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Glory; his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, Faithfulneſs, All-ſufficiency, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs and Eternity to his People, as their Reſt and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to be poſſeſt, and injoyed by them for their good for ever.</hi> In a word, for God to ſay to a poor Creature, I will be thy God, is as much as if he ſhould ſay, look, whatever I am that I will be to thee; and look, whatever I can do, that I will do for thee, ſo far as thou art capable of the one or thee other, to make the happy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: I am a Fountain of Life, and ſuch will I be to thee; I am a God of Peace and Pardon, and ſuch will I be to thee; I am a God of Grace and Love, yea, I am a God that is Love it ſelf, and ſuch I will be to thee; I am the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Grace, and ſuch will I be to thee; I'le beget new Mercies for thee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day: I am a God of Comfort, yea, of all Comfort, and ſuch will I be to thee; I am an Unchangeable, Eternal, All-ſufficient God, and <pb n="168" facs="tcp:60044:96"/>ſuch will I be to thee. I can pardon guilty Souls, break the hardeſt Hearts, inlighten the darkeſt Minds, cleanſe the impureſt Spirits; I can make unbelieving Hearts, believing; I can ſupport drooping Spirits, &amp; all this I'le do for thee: I can carry thee through Life and Death, and bring thee ſafe to Heaven, and there communicate my ſelf to thee for ever, to the filling of thy Soul with delight and ſatisfaction, and this I will do for thee; and ſurely happy is the Soul, that has thus the Lord for his God, and well may he ſit down ſatisfied with him, and at Reſt in him. Now, my Beloved, hath God made over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Covenant to his People, as their Reſt, that in him they might find Reſt, and ſhould they not be at Reſt in him? O ſirs, Is not God enough for us? has he laid himſelf under bonds to us, to be a God to us, and to do like a God for us? and ſhould we not Reſt in him, and ſatisfie our ſelves with him alone? Surely we ſhould.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Obligation the Saints are under to live at in God, is this; They have ſolemnly voucht and choſen, and often do vouch and chuſe God to be their Reſt and Happineſs. As God has freely made over himſelf in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them, ſo they have ſolemnly vouch't and choſen him, and often do ſolemnly vouch and chuſe him, to be their Reſt and Happineſs. When the Saints firſt enter into Covenant with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60044:96"/>God, then do they ſolemnly chuſe &amp; vouch him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be their God and Portion, their reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: their language to God then is, Lord, thou ſhall be my Lord, my Reſt, my Portion, my Happineſs, my all for ever; I will have none in Heaven, or on Earth, but thy ſelf. Thus <hi>David</hi> had choſen God, and he puts his Soul in mind of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O, my Soul,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>thou haſt ſaid unto God, thou art my Lord;</hi> thou haſt choſen God for thy God, thy Portion, thy Happineſs; and upon this account he calls his Soul to Reſt in God, and in him he Reſts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.6. And as at their firſt entring into Covenant with God, ſo alſo often afterwards, upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions, do they chuſe and vouch God for their Reſt, Portion, and Happineſs for ever; they make new choices of God, and do lay new claimes to him as theirs, in their procedure of their walking with him. — Sometimes upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of outward troubles and afflictions, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and diſtreſſes, they make a new choice of God, and vouch him afreſh for their Reſt and Happineſs: So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31.14. <hi>I truſted in thee, O Lord, I ſaid, thou art my God:</hi> here he makes a new choice of God, and layes a new claim to him as his; and when, or upon what occaſion was this? When he was ſurrounded with outward troubles, as appears. <hi>v.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13.
<hi>My life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing; I was a reproach among all mine <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60044:97"/>Enemies, I am forgotten, as a dead man out of minds I have heard the ſlander of many, fear was on every ſide, they deviſed to take away my life;</hi> and being thus diſtreſt, he flees to God, and chuſes him afreſh, and layes a freſh claim to him: So again,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4, 5. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, but there was no man that would know me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuge failed me, no man cared for my Soul:</hi> Well, and what then? Why, he runs to God, &amp; vouches him afreſh for his: <hi>I cryed unto thee, O Lord, I ſaid, thou art my refuge, and my portion in the Land of the living:</hi> So the Church, in Her great troubles and afflictions, does in like manner: <hi>the Lord is my Portion</hi> (ſaith She) <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. — Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon occaſion of ſome eminent mercy or deliverance wrought by God for them, they do make a new choice of God, and vouch him afreſh to be theirs: ſo thoſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is become my Salvation: He is my God, &amp; I will prepare him an Habitation; my Fathers God, &amp; I will exult him:</hi> He wrought a ſignal deliverance for them, he had carried them through the Red Sea, delivered them from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom he drowned for their ſakes, and now they ſing a ſong of praiſe to God, and vouch him to be their God, they renew Covenant with God, and ſo their choice of him, as their Reſt, their Portion, their All for ever. Thus the Church does, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever, and ever, he <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60044:97"/>will be our God and guide even unto Death:</hi> God had done great things for Her, and hereupon ſhe vouches him afreſh for hers. <hi>David</hi> often does the like, — ſometimes again upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome freſh diſcoveries made of God in his love and beauty to them, or their being taken into ſome near and intimate communion with him, then they chuſe him afreſh, and vouch him to be theirs afreſh: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> whoever he was, did; <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> (ſaies he to God) <hi>and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee; thou art the Rock of my Heart, and my Portion for ever:</hi> Here is a new choice of God made by this holy Man; and upon what occaſion was it? Why, he had been with God in his Sanctuary, that is, he had been converſing with God in his Word and Ordinances, he had had ſome new diſplayes and diſcoveries of his Love, Beauty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency made to him; and hereupon he chuſes God afreſh and vouches him to be his All, both in Heaven and upon Earth. So, you know, when the Spouſe had been led into the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Houſe by Chriſt, and had had the Banner of his Love diſplayed over Her; when She had been feaſted by him in his Houſe of Wine, then She made a new choice of Chriſt, and vouches him for hers afreſh: <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2.6. Thus the Saints, both at firſt, and alſo often afterwards in their walking
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60044:98"/>with God, have choſen, and do chuſe him to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their God and Portion, their Reſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhould they not then Reſt in him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Surely this choice of theirs calls aloud, and ſhould be a mighty Obligation upon them, to live at Reſt in God for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Obligation the Saints are under to live at Reſt in God is this, God is at Reſt in them: as the Saints have choſen God for their Reſt, ſo God hath choſen them for his Reſt, and his Soul is at Reſt in them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14 <hi>The Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his Habitation; this is my Reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it.</hi> Zion here is a Type of the Church and People of God, and as ſuch God's Soul is at Reſt in Her; <hi>This is my Reſt:</hi> The Saints are, and to eternity will be, a delight and ſolace to the Soul of God; God is indeed delighted, and at Reſt in his People, above all the workes of his hands; Hence the Church is called <hi>The delight of God,</hi> Iſa. 62.4. Hence alſo he is ſaid to <hi>rejoice over them with joy, to reſt in his love upon them, and to joy over them with ſinging,</hi> Zeph. 3.18. God is in ſome ſort more delighted and at Reſt in his People, than in the Angels themſelves; and indeed he ſees a greater beauty and glory upon them, than upon the Angels; he looks upon the Angels, as ſtanding in their own Beauty, their own Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only; but he looks upon his Saints, as <pb n="173" facs="tcp:60044:98"/>ſtanding in, and cloathed with the Beauty and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and that is much more glorious than the Angels: The Beauty and Righteouſneſs of the Angels, is the Beauty and Righteouſneſs but of Creatures; but the Beauty and Righteouſneſs of the Saints, is the Beauty and Righteouſneſs of him, that is God-man, God as well as Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. and on this account, God's Soul is more at Reſt in them, God is chiefly delighted, and at Reſt in himſelf, and the perfections of his own being; next to himſelf, his Soul is delighted and at reſt in Chriſt, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: <hi>Behold mine Elect, in whom my Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth</hi> (ſaith the Father of him) Iſa. 42.1. and next to Chriſt the Mediator, his Soul is at Reſt in his Saints and People in and through Chriſt; he looks upon them not as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they are in Chriſt; not as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apart from Chriſt, but as made one with Chriſt, and ſo as ſhining in his Beauty, and clothed with his Righteouſneſs as participating in all his Amiableneſſes; he lookes upon them, not ſo much according to what they are at preſent, as according to what they are in the Counſels of his own love, and what he intends to make them, and ſo they are
<hi>all glorious,</hi> both <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without;</hi> and accordingly he is delighted in them. Now is God's Soul at Reſt in them? and ſhould not their Souls be at Reſt in him? O what a mighty Obligation is this upon them alwaycs to be at Reſt in God!</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60044:99"/>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Obligation the Saints are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to live at Reſt in God is this; They hope to, and aſſuredly ſhall live at Reſt in God, and with God for ever in Heaven: Heaven is a ſtate of Reſt; ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> repreſents it; <hi>their remaineth a Reſt to the People of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9. 'tis a ſtate of Reſt in God, and with God, and in this Reſt the Saints hope to live, and live for ever: Hence they are ſaid to <hi>have this Hope: every one that hath this Hope,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.
<hi>this Hope,</hi> that is, the Hope of ſeeing Chriſt, and being made like him in the other World, the Hope of Heaven the eternal Reſt: Saints then are perſons that have this Hope, hence alſo Heaven, and the Reſt to come, is called <hi>Hope, the Hope which is laid up for you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spem hic poſuit pro rc ſperata, nam ſpes in animis noſtris, eſt gloria quam ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Caelis. <hi>Calv. in Loc.</hi>
                  </note> Col. 1.5. and <hi>the bleſſed Hope, looking for the bleſſed Hope,</hi> Tit. 2.13. In both theſe places Heaven, and the coming Reſt, is called <hi>Hope;</hi> For
<hi>Hope</hi> here (as <hi>Calvin</hi> and others obſerve) is put for the Object of Hope, or the Good hoped for: But why is it called Hope? For this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Reaſons; becauſe 'tis the great Object of the Saints Hopes;
'tis what they hope, and look, and long for: And as they hope to, ſo aſſuredly they ſhall live at Reſt in God, and with God for ever; 'tis what remains to them, and they ſhall, in due time, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60044:99"/>unto it: Hence 'tis ſaid to be <hi>laid up for them in Heaven,</hi> in that prequoted place <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. which (as
<hi>Calvin</hi> alſo obſerves) notes the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, and of their injoying of it; 'tis what they cannot miſs of,<note place="margin">Quum dieit ſpem nobis repoſitam eſſe in Caelo, ſignificat perinde certos debere eſſe fideles de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſione aeternae foeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatis, <hi>&amp;c. Calv.</hi>
                  </note> when the <hi>Apoſtle ſpeaks of an Hope laid up in Heaven for us, he ſignifies to us, that the Saints ought therefore to Reſt ſure and certain of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal Life, as if they had a treaſure already bid, and laid up in a moſt ſafe place.</hi> Now do the Saints hope to, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhall they live at Reſt in God, and with God for ever; and ſhould they not be at Reſt in God here? Surely this is a mighty Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon them to be alwaies at Reſt in him. Thus you have ſeen ſome of thoſe Obligations the Saints lie under to live at Reſt in God, which though but ſome of them, yet are ſufficient to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the truth of our Poſition, namely that they ſhould alwaies be at Reſt in him.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The Truth aſſerted, further evidenced from the excellency of this frame of Soul; the worth and excellency whereof is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the Saints are under many great and weighty Obligations to be alwaies at Reſt in God, ſo to be alwaies at Reſt in God is a choice and an excellent frame and poſture of Soul for the Saints to live in; 'tis indeed the beſt and moſt becoming frame of Soul, they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be found in this World, which may give further evidence to our Aſſertion: Now I ſhall ſhew you a little of the worth and excellency of this frame and poſture of Soul in a few Sripture-Propoſitions about it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be at Reſt in God is a very gracious frame and poſture of Soul, a frame and poſture of Soul which carries much of the life and power of Grace and Godlineſs in it: and O what an excellent frame and poſture muſt this then be? the more of the life and power of Grace and Godlineſs any frame or poſture of Soul carries in it, the more excellent it is; now there is no <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60044:100"/>frame or poſture of Soul, that I know of, which carryes-more of the life and power of Grace and Godlineſs in it, than this of being at Reſt in God does: Herein indeed does the main; if not the whole, of the life and power of Grace and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs conſiſt; for pray, what is Grace and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and wherein doth it conſiſt, but in an holy ſubjection to, and acquieſcence in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God? To bow and ſubmit to God, as our Lord, and to chuſe and acquieſce in God, as our Happineſs, this is Grace, this is Godlineſs; both which I take to be comprehended in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.2. where <hi>David</hi> puts his Soul in mind, that he had both given up himſelf to God, and alſo choſen him for his Happineſs, ſaying, <hi>O my Soul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord,</hi> my Ruler, my Happineſs: This, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is Grace, or Godlineſs; and the more of this there is found in us, the more gracious we are; and what is this, but to be at Reſt in God, as we have opened it? A reſtleſs and unquiet Spirit argues much of the power of fin, and ſhews that Grace has gotten but little, if any, dominion in the Soul; and therefore
'tis made both the Character and the Judgement of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, that they cannot Reſt: <hi>The wicked</hi> (ſaith the prophet) <hi>are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot Reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up mire and dirt, there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.20, 21. 'Tis meant of their own inward unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60044:101"/>anreſtleſſneſs of Spirit:
<hi>Calvin</hi> hereby underſtands <hi>perpetuas animae exagitationes atque perturbationes,</hi> perpetual toſſings and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind; and he ſpeaks (I remember) thus: <hi>This Similitude of a Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Elegans eſt iſta ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſimilitudo, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima ad explican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam inquietudinem impiorum; nam in ſeipſo turbaturmare, tametſi a vento non impellitur, &amp;c. eodem modo impii turban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur inteſtino malo, quod in ipſorum animis defixum eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>is an elegant Similitude, and moſt apt to ſet forth the inquietude of wicked men; for</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the Sea is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in it ſelf, though it be not driven by Winds, nor toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, but its own Waves fight own with another, and break one another; in like manner, wicked men are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with inteſtine evil, which is fixt and rooted in their own minds.</hi> Thus a reſtleſs unquiet Spirit argues much of the power of ſin in the Soul, and ſhews that Grace has gotten but little, if any Dominion there: So on the other hand, a Spirit at Reſt in God muſt carry much of the life and power of Grace and Godlineſs in it. This indeed is a great part of the Kingdom of God; for <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> (the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>conſiſts not in Meats and Drinks, but in Righteouſneſs, in Peace, and in the Joys of the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>In Peace,</hi> that is, (as a learned Man expounds it,) in an holy Reſt and quiet of Soul in God.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60044:101"/>
               <p n="2">2. To be at Reſt in God, is a ready frame and poſture of Soul; a frame and poſture of Soul, which renders a man ready and prepared for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Call of God to him; and muſt not that be an excellent frame? God, my Beloved, may call us to what he pleaſes, to what ſervices he pleaſes, and to what conditions he pleaſes; he may call us to what ſervices he pleaſes; beſides the general duties of Chriſtianity which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon all, he may call us to what ſpecial work and ſervices he pleaſes; he may call us to do, and he may call us to ſuffer, and 'tis a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing to be fitted and prepared for the Call of God; and who more ſo, than he that lives at Reſt in him? Alas, to ſuch an one no Work, no Duty, no Service is unſeaſonable; ſuch an one is fit to Pray, and fit to Praiſe; fit to Hear, and fit to Meditate; fit to ſearch his own Heart, and fit to enquire into the Counſels of God; he is fit to do, and fit to ſuffer the Will of God: <hi>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed;</hi> or (as you have it the margin of ſome of your Bibles) <hi>my heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared,</hi> Pſal. 57.7. If you look back upon the firſt verſe, you will find his Soul ſweetly at Reſt in God; For (ſaies he)
<hi>O God my Soul truſteth in thee, in the ſhadow of, thy wings will I make my refuge;</hi> and being thus at Reſt in God, his heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: 'Tis in a ready poſture for duty and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; O, 'tis the reſtleſneſs and diſcompoſure <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60044:102"/>of our hearts, that unfits and indiſpoſes us for our Work and Duty. When the <hi>Iſraelites were filled with anguiſh of Spirit, they could not hear Moſes,</hi> Exod. 6.9. and when
<hi>Jonah</hi> his Spirit was off its Reſt, though he were an eminent Prophet of God, he could not pray but very peeviſhly and unbecomingly, <hi>Jon.</hi>
4.2.3. A reſtleſs Spirit is unfit for the ordinary duties of Chriſtianity: But now take a Soul that is indeed at Reſt in God, and he is fit not only for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dutys of Chriſtianity, ſuch as Prayer, Hearing, or the like; but even for whatever Work or Duty God ſhall call him out unto, though never ſo difficult, or never ſo mean: Such an one may in his place and ſtation ſay, as, I Remember, one brings in <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking to God, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>if thou wilt make me a Shepherd to keep Sheep, or if thou wilt make me a King to govern thy People; behold, mine heart is prepared, I am in a ready poſture for the one or the other.</hi> Oh, what a ſweet frame is this? God may alſo call us to what Condition he pleaſes, to a Condition of Fullneſs, or of Want, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, or Affliction, and the like; now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Condition he calls to, the Soul that is at Reſt in him, is ready for it. Does God call him to ſufferings, to take up and bear the Croſs? He is ready for this Call of God, for he can <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea, glory in the Croſs, Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>He can ſing in a Priſon,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> did,
<hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60044:102"/>Does God call him to Fulneſs?
<hi>He knows how to abound;</hi> Does God call him to Wants? <hi>He knows how to be abaſed:</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 12. Does God call him to Mourning? he is ready for it; for he, and indeed he alone knows how
<hi>to weep as if he wept not:</hi> Does God call him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing? He is ready for it; for he, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can <hi>rejoyce as if he rejoyced not,</hi> which is the fitteſt poſture and carriage for each condition, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30. In a word, he is fit to live, and fit to die; and let me tell you, that is a great Word, yet a true one, he is fit to die, ready in a good meaſure for another World; 'Tis a great thing to die, and 'tis a great attainment to be ready to die; and that that Soul is, that is at Reſt in God. I ſcarce know a more deſirable frame, and poſture to die in than this, of being at Reſt in God: Now if it be a frame of Soul which thus renders a man ready for every Call of God to him, ſurely it muſt then be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To live at Reſt in God, is a ſafe frame and poſture of Soul; a frame and poſture of Soul, that ſecures a man againſt danger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an excellent frame.

               <p n="4">4. To live at Reſt in God is a very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able frame and poſture of Soul, a frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Soul, which is attended with much Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comfort and Communion with God; which alſo ſpeaks the excellency of it. A Soul, living at Reſt in God has uſually the fulleſt Comforts, and the ſweeteſt Communion with God of any on this ſide Heaven: The truth is, the thing it ſelf carrys unexpreſſible ſweetneſs in it; beſides God's delight to manifeſt himſelf to thoſe that live in the exerciſe of it.

                  </note> but be quiet and ſedate in thine own Soul: Well, but what ſhall I gain by it? Why, <hi>Thereby good ſhall come unto thee?</hi> And what Good? Not only outward, temporal Good, but alſo Spiritual Good, the Good of Grace, the Good of divine Conſolations, the Good of Communion with God, and the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manifeſtations of his Love. O, the more a Man's Soul is at Reſt in God, the more full will his Comforts, and the more intimate will his Communion with God be: As for a reſtleſs, diſturbed Spirit, 'tis ſo like the Devil (as by and <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60044:105"/>by you will hear) that God cannot tell how to be much with it, nor yet to do much in a way of ſpecial Grace and Spiritual Comfort for it. Chriſtians complain many times, that they have but little Communion with God, but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his Love and preſence with them; and one reaſon, among others, why they have cauſe ſo to complain is, becauſe they are no more at Reſt in God: were they more at Reſt in him, he would Reſt more in his Love, his Grace, his Preſence with, and upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To live at Reſt in God, is a God-like Frame and Poſture of Soul, which greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles God, and is ſuitable to Him, and which brings us up into the very Life and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of God himſelf; and what a choice frame muſt it then needs be? the more likeneſs and reſemblance any thing carries in it to God; and the more any thing brings us into the Life and Bleſſedneſs of God, the more excellent it is; now, there is nothing does more reſemble God, or is more ſuitable to him; nothing that brings us more up into the life and likeneſs of God, than to be thus at Reſt in him in our own Souls: This indeed is the very Life and Perfection of God, the poſture (if I may ſo ſpeak) which God himſelf lives in; for he is ever at Reſt in himſelf, he is infinitely well-pleaſed with what he himſelf does, and Reſts infinitely ſatisfied with his own Fulneſs and Excellencies: God is <pb n="187" facs="tcp:60044:105"/>his own Reſt, his own Centre; God is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted with his own Will, and infinitely ſatisfied with his own Fulneſs, and ſo is at Reſt in himſelf, which indeed is his bleſſedneſs: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the more our Souls are at Reſt in him, the more do we reſemble him, and are brought into his Life and his Bleſſedneſs. A reſtleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Spirit does above all things reſemble the Devil, and is ſuitable to the Devil; 'tis indeed the very life, image, and ſpirit of the Devil, for the Devil is a reſtleſs, unquiet Spirit, always acting in oppoſition to God, and always fretting at the Diſpenſations of God: <hi>He ſeeks Reſt, but finds none,</hi> Mat. 12.43. As wicked ones can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Reſt, ſo neither can the wicked one Reſt, but is perpetually diſturbed: Now as a reſtleſs, unquiet Spirit reſembles the Devil, and is the very Life and Image of the Devil, ſo to be at Reſt in God is what reſembles God, and is the very Life of God in the Soul; 'tis what brings us up int the Divine Life, the Divine Bleſſedneſs; and O what an excellent frame muſt this be?</p>
               <p n="6">6. To live at Reſt in God, is a God-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame and poſture of Soul, a frame of Soul that does much honour God, and give Glory to Him; and therefore muſt have much worth and excellency in it. Of all Frames, as well as Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is the beſt, that does honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God moſt, and what frame of Soul does more honour and glorifie God than this of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60044:106"/>being at Reſt in him? This gives to God the glory of his Sovereignty, and the glory of his Sufficiency, two of the brighteſt Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in the Crown of Heaven: it owns and acknowledges God to be both beſt and greateſt, the higheſt Lord, and the chiefeſt Good, and ſo it gloriſies God as God, it ſets him up as God in the Soul, and gives him the honour due unto his Name, as ſuch. Reſtleſs, diſturbed, unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Spirits do darken and obſcure the Glory of God, they are <hi>Cenſores Divinitatis</hi> (as one of the Ancients ſpeakes of them) they cenſure the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, and do in effect deny and diſown the Sovereignty of God, the Wiſdom of God, the Goodneſs, the Faithfulneſs of God, the Fulneſs, Sufficiency, and Perfection of the Holy One; they do in effect ſay that God's Will is not a Good, a Wiſe, and an Holy Will, that there is not enough in God to ſatisfie Souls, and make them happy; and O what an affront &amp; diſhonour is this to the Majeſty of Heaven? But now the Soul that is indeed at Reſt in God, he gives him the Glory of all, he ſets the Crown where it ought to be; and Oh how much does this ſpeak out the worth and excellency of this frame of Soul?</p>
               <p n="7">7. To live at Reſt in God, is an honoured and highly eſteemed Frame and Poſture of Soul, and that by God himſelf, a frame and poſture of Soul which God has a great honour for, and <pb n="189" facs="tcp:60044:106"/>puts a great value upon; which alſo ſpeaks the excellency of it: there is ſcarce any frame of Soul that God more values, honours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, than this of an Holy Reſt <hi>in</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: this is <hi>in the ſight of God of great price: Put on the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which in the ſight of God is of great price:</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. In the ſight of men, at leaſt unholy and unſpiritual Men, 'tis of little price, of no price, they deſpiſe and contemn it; but God has other thoughts, and other values of it, he highly eſteems and honours it, he looks on it as one of the choiceſt Ornaments, as one of the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of any Soul; Now certainly that is beſt, which God values and honours moſt: As that which honours God moſt, ſo that which God moſt honours, muſt have moſt of true worth and excellency in it. A reſtleſs, unquiet Spirit on the one hand, or a Spirit at Reſt in the Creature on the other hand, is what God abhors and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes; but a Spirit at Reſt in himſelf he highly values.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To live at Reſt in God is a heavenly Frame and Poſture of Soul, a frame and poſture of Soul which carries much of Heaven in it; 'tis indeed in a great meaſure the Life of Heaven here on Earth; and what then more excellent than this? Pray, my Beloved, what is Heaven, and the Life of Heaven, the Life which the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels live in Heaven? Heaven is a ſtate of <hi>Reſt, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:60044:107"/>Heb.</hi> 4.9. and what is that
<hi>Reſt?</hi> True, there is an external Reſt, there is a Reſt from Labour and Trouble, from Conflict and Temptation; but the main of it is the inward Reſt of the Soul, that Reſt and Complacency which the Soul injoys in God, and ſhall injoy in him, and with him for ever: there the Soul is filled with God, he is perfectly ſwallowed up in the Divine Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorowly conformed thereunto, and he has the perfect Viſion and Frnition of the Divine Glory and Fulneſs, <hi>ſeeing him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. And in both theſe he is filled with even an infinite content and ſatisfaction of Heart, this is the True Reſt of Heaven: and what is the Life which the Saints and Angels live there? 'Tis a Life of Perfect Reſt and Solace in God, ſuch Reſt and Solace in God, as that they never think of going out to any thing elſe whatever. <hi>God is all in all to them,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. Thus to be at Reſt in God is an heavenly frame and poſture of Soul; and O what an excellent frame muſt this be? Well then, lay all theſe eight Things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you ſhall find an incomparable Worth and Excellency in it, which is a further evidence of the Saints Duty and Intereſt to live therein.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The Truth particularly improved. The Saints called upon to live thus at Reſt in God. Arguments urged to induce them ſo to do.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHat it is for the Soul to be at Reſt in God, what Obligations the Saints are under to live at Reſt in him, the excellency of this frame and poſture of Spirit, you have ſeen laid open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; Now what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? O, that all who profeſs themſelves to be Saints, or would be accounted ſo, would give all diligence, always to live thus at Reſt in God. Poſſibly ſome of us are quite off our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, our Souls are full of ſtormes and tempeſts, toſſings and tumblings, they are not only <hi>caſt down,</hi> but alſo <hi>diſquieted within us,</hi> (as holy
<hi>David's</hi> ſometimes was) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. Others of us perhaps are at Reſt, but 'tis a ſinful Reſt, at Reſt in the Creature, and not in God; at Reſt in carnal, ſenſible things; we are of thoſe who <hi>are at eaſe in Zion;</hi> yea, perhaps we are even ſinging that mad
<hi>Requiem</hi> to our Souls, that that fool ſometimes did, <hi>Luk.</hi>
12.19. <hi>Soul take <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60044:108"/>thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt Goods laid up for thee for many years:</hi> But now this truth, and the things declared about it do call upon the one and the other of us to return to God, as our Reſt, and to centre purely and entirely in him alone: This Truth calls off the one from all thoſe unquiet Motions and Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are within us, from all our toſſings and tumblings, to an holy Calm and Quiet of heart in God; and it calls off the other from all our falſe Reſts and Repoſes, to an holy Reſt and Repoſe in God; and Oh that both the one and the other would hear and obey this Call, taking up our Reſt in God alone. O, my Beloved! are you under ſuch obligations to live at Reſt in God, as you are? and yet will you not live at Reſt in him? On the other hand, Is the frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Soul ſo excellent? and will you neglect it, and not ſtudy to be found alwayes therein? Let me recapitulate a little particularly: Has God freely made over himſelf in all his Fulneſs and Riches, in his Covenant to you, as your Reſt and Portion for ever, and yet will you not live at Reſt in him? Have you choſen God, and voucht him for your God and Portion, and yet will you not live at Reſt in him? Is God ſo much (as you have heard) at Reſt in you, and yet will you not live at Reſt in him? Shall you, and do you hope to live at Reſt in God, and with God, for ever in Heaven, and yet will you not <pb n="193" facs="tcp:60044:108"/>live at Reſt in him here? O me thinks theſe things ſhould conſtrain you. On the other hand, ſhould not the excellency of the frame alure you? would you live forth much of the life and power of Grace? then live at Reſt in God. Would you be ready for every call of God to you, whether to do or to ſuffer, to live or to die? then live at Reſt in God. Would you be fenced and fortified againſt Temptation? then live at Reſt in God. Would you injoy much Spiritual Comfort and Communion with God? then live at Reſt in God. Would you be like God? Would you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God, and grow up into his Life and Bleſſedneſs? then live at Reſt in God. Would you honour God? you have greatly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; Would you now honour him? then live at Reſt in him. Would you live in Heaven, and begin the Life of Heaven here on Earth? then live at Reſt in God. O why ſhould we think of any other Reſt but God? or why ſhould we live in any other poſture of Soul but this, of a Reſt in him? is there any ſo ſweet, ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo becoming, as this? Oh let us labour, as near as poſſible, alwayes to be found in this poſture. Bleſſed be God, that we may Reſt in him: Two things we ſhould bleſs God for; one is, that there is a Reſt remaining for us in the other World, whether we find Reſt here or no; yet there is a Reſt to come, a bleſſed Reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. The other is, that there is a Reſt in God for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60044:109"/>us, and that we may enter into, and live in that Reſt even here; when there is no Reſt to be had in this Worlds Injoyments, no Reſt in or from the Creature; yet then there is a Reſt to be had in God, and from God, <hi>We that have believed, do enter into Reſt,</hi> Heb. 4.3. there is a Reſt in God, in the Will, the Preſence, the Love, the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, which we do, or may enter into, even here in this World; and bleſſed be God for this Reſt, and this is the Reſt which I am now calling you into. And yet a little further to ſet home the Call upon you, conſider a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider what a ſad and diſmal thing it is for a Soul to Reſt in any thing but God alone. A Reſt, one or another, the Soul will have: if God be not its Reſt, it will be taking up a Reſt elſewhere: Now, 'tis a ſad and woful thing for a Soul to Reſt any where but in God alone. <hi>Woe to them that are at eaſe in Zion,</hi> (ſaies the
<hi>Prophet</hi>) <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. Woe to them that are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and at Reſt in Zion; that is to ſay, that are at Reſt in carnal ſenſual things in Zion; ſo the <hi>Prophet</hi> afterwards explains himſelf; Woe to them that are at Reſt in the Creatures, that take up their ſolace and ſatisfaction in Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and not in God. To take up our Reſt in the Creatures, and not in God, is for us to prefer the Creature before God, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Creature without God, for our <pb n="195" facs="tcp:60044:109"/>Portion and Happineſs for ever: and, which is more, 'tis a dreadful Argument, that a Man's All lies in the Creature, and that God intends him nothing but the Creature for ever. <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that are Rich,</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>for you have received your conſolation,</hi> Luk.
6.24. <hi>Woe unto you that are Rich,</hi> that is, <hi>you, who Reſt in your Riches,</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> rightly expounds it) <hi>who take up your happineſs in theſe things. Woe unto you:</hi> and what Woe to them? truly a moſt dreadful Woe; <hi>You have received your conſolation,</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) you have all the good you are ever like to have, you ſhall have no more, and no other happineſs or conſolation for ever: Your reſting in theſe things, argues theſe things to be your All; and Oh, what a woeful, dreadful thing is it for a man to have his All in this World, in a few, vain, empty, bitter-ſweet, periſhing Vanities here! 'Twas a cutting, killing Word which <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought in giving <hi>Dives,</hi> when he ſaid,
<hi>Son, remember, that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things.</hi> Luke 16.25. He had all his happineſs in this World, which is the woe and miſery of ſuch, as take up their Reſt any where but in God alone: tremble therefore at this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how impoſſible it is to find any true Reſt, Solace, and Satisfaction of Soul any where but in God, and with God alone. You may as ſoon find Life in Death, or Light in <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60044:110"/>Darkneſs, as Reſt for your Souls any where, but in God alone.— Pray Friends, where will you look, or whither will you go to find Reſt, on this ſide God and Chriſt? Will you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſin, to your luſts? to theſe multitudes run; they purſue their Reſt, Solace, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from ſin, and the pleaſures of ſin; yea (as
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>they reſt not, unleſs they ſin,</hi> unleſs they do evil: But, my Beloved, is there Reſt to be found in ſin? Can that give Reſt, that is the greateſt evil in the World? Can that give Reſt, that is the cauſe of all our troubles and difficulties? Can that give Reſt, that is the cauſe of all the confuſions and deſolations that are in the World? Can that give Reſt, that was the firſt and onely cauſe and founder of Hell? Had there been no Sin, there had been no Hell: Can that give Reſt, that makes us like the Devil, that reſtleſs Spirit, yea, and that made him of a glorious Angel, a Devil? Can that give Reſt, that is infinitely contrary to God, that is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Object of his hatred, and that alone can and does ſeparate between God, the chief Good, and our Souls? O, the folly of Souls to purſue a Reſt in ſin, in the ſatisfaction of a luſt! True, a baſe, brutiſh pleaſure and delight wicked men take in ſin, (as he ſaid) <hi>Will it not be bitterneſs in the latter end? the wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Yea, and not only death at laſt, but many times anguiſh and torment here. Will you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60044:110"/>courſe to the good things of this World, to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts and Injoyments, to Friends, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Eſtate, and the like? Theſe thouſands make their Reſt practically, Saying with him,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for thee for many years:</hi> thou haſt a good trade, a fair eſtate, pleaſant injoyments, <hi>take thine eaſe, Soul,</hi> ſit thou down at Reſt: But, my Beloved, can theſe things give Reſt? Alas, 'tis, the joynt-language of all the Creatures to us, Reſt and Happineſs for your Souls is not to be found in us, ſeek it elſewhere, if you intend to find it: <hi>The Creatures</hi> (ſayes a worthy Divine) <hi>are not good, at leaſt, they are not the Souls Good; nothing</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>but an infinite God-head can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay your hunger after happineſs,</hi> Can Wind, can Vanity, can a Shadow, can a Fancy, can things of nought, things that are not, things that are even made up of emptineſs and changeableneſs, give Reſt? Such (you know) theſe things are in Scripture repreſented to be. Could theſe things have given Reſt; why had not <hi>Solomon</hi> found it in them? He had certainly the fulleſt enjoyment of them that ever man had, and not only ſo, but moreover he had wiſdom and skill to extract the ſweetneſs of them, to improve whatever they have in them yea, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Wiſdom and skill of his to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; for he ſet himſelf (as he tells us) to enjoy whatever the Creature could poſſibly afford, he <pb n="198" facs="tcp:60044:111"/>gave himſelf up to a full enjoyment of all: Well, but did he find Reſt in them after all? no he was ſo far from finding Reſt, that he cries out of all,
<hi>All is Vanity and vexation of Spirit;</hi> and this he does often, (you know) <hi>All is vanity and vexation of Spirit;</hi> and can <hi>vanity and vexation of Spirit</hi> give Reſt? What if a man has an affluence, an abundance of theſe things, and they are alſo increaſing daily? Will they not afford a Reſt for him then? No, <hi>he that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe, this alſo is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.10. Silver, abundance, encreaſe, all is Vanity, and cannot give Reſt. And, my Beloved, does not our experience tell us the ſame thing? Alas, did we ever find any true Reſt and Satisfaction of Soul in theſe things? True, we are apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves Reſt in this and that, in this Condition, and that Injoyment; but did we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find that, which we promiſed our ſelves? Have we not alwayes met with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? We have dreamed of a Reſt in theſe things; but it has been but a dream; it has been with us, as 'tis in the <hi>Prophet, Iſa.</hi> 29.8. <hi>It ſhall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold be eateth: but he awaketh, and his Soul is empty; or, as when a thirſty man dreameth, and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his Soul hath appetite:</hi> Juſt ſo 'tis, and it has been with us, while we are, or have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60044:111"/>Reſt, and promiſing our ſelves Reſt in and from the Creature: yea, and others of the Saints have experienced and aſſerted the ſame thing;<note place="margin">Dura ſunt omnia &amp; tu ſolus requies.</note> 
                  <hi>All things</hi> (ſaies
<hi>Aug.</hi>) <hi>are full of trouble and difficulty; thou alone, O God, art the true Reſt.</hi> And 'tis a great Speech of his, worthy to be written upon the Table of all our Hearts, ſpeaking to Souls who are gone off from God:

                  <hi>and cleave unto him that made you; ſtand with him, and ye ſhall ſtand; Reſt in him, and ye ſhall Reſt.</hi> And again, ſaies he, <hi>Reſt and Happineſs is not to be found where you ſeek it; ſeek what you ſeek, but know, that 'tis not to be found where you ſeek it. You ſeek a Bleſſed Life in the Region of Death, and 'tis not there; for how ſhould a bleſſed Life be found there, where there is not ſo much as Life it ſelf?</hi> The ſum of all ſeems to be this, that thoſe that deſert God, do go from the true Reſt and Happineſs of Souls; and to ſeek Reſt and Happineſs any where but in God and Chriſt, is to ſeek the Living among the Dead. Once <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60044:112"/>more, will you have recourſe to your ſelves, and be your own Reſt? Indeed we read, that <hi>a good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf,</hi> Prov. 14.14. but how
<hi>from himſelf? from himſelf</hi> in Union and Communion with his God:
<hi>from himſelf</hi> as in Communion with him that is the chief Good, that has all Good in him, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: and therefore obſerve, <hi>the good man</hi> here ſtands in oppoſition to <hi>the back-ſlider,</hi> one that is gone off from God: our ſelves, conſidered abſtractly in themſelves, are moſt inſufficient to give reſt to the ſoul, being moſt vain, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<note place="margin">In omnibus quae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur, requiem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivi, &amp; veram requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em in eis invenire non potui; deinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens ad me conſiſtere in meipſo non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, quoniam mens mea valde leris eſt. <hi>Ber.</hi>

I'le cloſe this Argument with a weighty ſpeech, which I have read in a worthy Divine of our own, Bleſſed Mr.
<hi>Burroughes,</hi> Who ſpeaking of God's being the Reſt and Portion of his People, ſpeaks thus:
<q>Suppoſe (ſaies he) that God ſhould cauſe all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60044:112"/>the Kings and Emperors in the World, to come and caſt down their Crowns at the foot of an holy Soul, and ſay, all theſe are thine; he would anſwer, this is not enough, for this is not God himſelf: Suppoſe God ſhould bring all the ſplendours of all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth, and they ſhould be caſt at the foot of an holy Soul as his; he would ſay, This is not enough, this is not God himſelf: Suppoſe God ſhould cauſe all the Glory of Heaven, not only of Sun, Moon, and Stars, but alſo of the higheſt Heaven abſtract from God, to be laid before an holy Soul as his, he would ſay, This is not enough, this is not God himſelf: Once more, Should all the Angels come, and ſay, to an holy Soul, We are ſent to put all our Glory upon thee; he would ſay, This is not enough, for this is not God himſelf. O, nothing but God in Chriſt can give Reſt to Souls.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider what a bleſſed Reſt God is for Souls, or that Souls may find in God. As there is an utter impoſſibility of finding Reſt any where, but in God; ſo in him there is a bleſſed Reſt to be found for Souls, a full, a perfect, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſt. O, my Beloved, what can your Souls deſire, or what are they capable of, that is not to be found in God? Would you have Good? it muſt be Good that can give Reſt to the Soul: God is Good, he is the chief Good, the beſt, the higheſt Good; he is Goodneſs it ſelf, <pb n="202" facs="tcp:60044:113"/>he is Good in himſelf, and he is the Spring and Fountain of all that <hi>good</hi> that is in the Creature: he is ſo Good, as that he is the Good of all Good, and nothing has any thing of Goodneſs in it, but as it reſembles him and participates of him.<note place="margin">Bonus eſt qui ſecit me, &amp; ipſe eſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num meum, &amp; illi exulto omnibus bonis meis.</note>

<hi>and thou art alwayes at Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art thine own Reſt.</hi> That little <hi>good</hi> that is found in the Creature is narrow, ſcanty, and but here and there a drop: but God has all Good in a bleſſed Union and conjunction in him. O how glorious a Reſt may the Soul find in him! — Would you have a ſuitable and convenient Good? ſuch a Good is God, he is a ſuitable and convenient Good, a Good ſuitable to the Nature, Life, and Wants of the Soul: Among all your Creature-Injoyments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, there is nothing ſuitable either to the Nature or Life of the Soul: they are carnal, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, and ſo are ſuitable to the fleſh and ſenſual part, and are pleaſing to it; but they have nothing ſuitable in them to an immortal Spirit, nothing that an eternal Soul can feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Body may as ſoon feed upon Air and Aſhes, as the Soul upon Creatures. But now in God there is that Good, that is every way ſuitable to the Soul, to the Nature, Life, and Wants of the Soul: the Soul is of a Spiritual Nature, and God is a Spiritual Good; <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> Joh. 4.24. The Soul is of a vaſt capacity, 'tis next to Infiniteneſs in its capacity and deſires; and God is a vaſt and comprehenſive <pb n="204" facs="tcp:60044:114"/>Good, having (as has been ſhewn) all good in him: Without ſuitableneſs in the Object to the faculty, there can be no Reſt. — Would you have an original, independent Good? ſuch a Good is God:<note place="margin">Dulcius ex ipſo fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, petuntur aquoe.</note> 
                  <hi>Waters drink moſt pleaſantly at the Fountain-head:</hi> In God you have all Good, all Sweet, all Comfort at the Fountain-head. Hence he is ſaid to be <hi>a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Living Waters,</hi> and the Creatures <hi>broken Ciſterns,</hi> Jer. 2.13. the Fountain has all in and from it ſelf, but Ciſterns you know have no more than is put into them; all that Good that is in God he has it in and from himſelf; but the Creatures, yea, the beſt of Creatures, Angels themſelves not excepted, have no more than he puts into them: Now how much is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be preferred before a Ciſtern? — Would you have a pure and an unmixed Good, Gold that has no Droſs, Wine that has no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it? ſuch a Good is God:
<hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5. All things on this ſide God have their mixtures, they have a dark as well as a bright ſide; all this Wine is mixt with Wormwood, this Gold with Droſs: Who of us did ever meet with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Injoyment that had not many allayes? the ſweeteſt Roſe has its prickles, and the rareſt Beauty its ſpots among the Creatures; but now God is every way a pure and an unmixed Good,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60044:114"/>he is all Light, Life, Love, Holineſs, and the like. — Would you have a ſweet and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good? Such a Good is God; yea indeed there is infinite ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction to be found in him; he can infinitely delight, raviſh, ſolace, and ſatisfy the Soul for ever. O how ſweet, how ſatisfying are the Sights of God, the Taſtes and Deſcents of his Love! what an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does one ſight of God, one deſcent of his Love, make in the Soul! <hi>David</hi> caſting his eye upon God, as his in Covenant, is even raviſhed with it, and cryes out, <hi>the lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places, I have a goodly Heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16.5,

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. and <hi>Aug.</hi> (I remember) ſpeaking of God, and to him, often breaks out into ſuch language as this, <hi>O, my God, my Life,</hi>

Oh how ſweet is it to be led into the Banquetting Houſe by Chriſt, and there have the Banner of his Love diſplayed over us, and Flagons of that Wine poured out unto us! How ſweet is it to have one ſight of the King in his beauty, how much more to walk and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him in his Galleryes? How ſweet is it with God in his Sanctuary, and have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing Himſelf, his Love, his Beauty, his Glory to us? <hi>O taſte and ſee how good the Lord is!</hi> Would you have a ſure, eternal, and unchangeable Good, a Good that never fades, failes, nor has any period? ſuch a Good is God, and God alone: <hi>From everlaſting to everlaſting be is God;</hi> Pſal. 90.2. But this has been ſufficiently ſpoken to elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Well, you ſee, what a bleſſed Reſt God is for Souls. Why then ſhould we ever think of looking out any where elſe for Reſt? O wretched hearts of ours, that will leave this God and go out to a vain World, and dying Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Reſt and Happineſs! In a word, if God has all that in him which thou needeſt, or art capable of, to give thee Reſt and Happineſs, than retire ſolely to him for it: Now what doſt thou want? or what art thou capable of to give thee Reſt and

I'le leave only two Scriptures with you, one out of the Old, and the other out of the New-Teſtament, both which I am apt to think may have a great aſpect to the preſent dayes, and may in a great meaſure receive their accompliſhment in them.

3.8. <hi>Wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day that I ariſe up to the prey; for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination is to gather the Nations, that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms, to pour out upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of jealouſy.</hi> The other is that <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25, 26. <hi>There ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars,</hi> (and theſe we have had) <hi>and upon the <pb n="209" facs="tcp:60044:116"/>Earth diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring; mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the Earth; for the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> I ſay nothing, only I fear, I fear, as we have ſeen ſome of theſe things accompliſht, ſo there will be a more full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them, and that ere the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration paſſes away. Doubtleſs great ſtormes are a coming, and happy they that have an Ark to hide themſelves in; God has now great Works to do, he has the Kingdom of Antichriſt utterly to deſtroy, the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of his Son Chriſt to ſet up in its Luſtre and Glory; the final Redemption of his People to work out, his ancient Ones to call in, and his ſuffering Name, Attributes, and Glory fully to right and vindicate, and theſe things are not like to be brought about without great Stormes, Convulſions, and Concuſſions in the World: Well, and what is the language of all this to us? Verily this, Souls retire into God, take up your Reſt in him, make him your All, both here and in eternity: and Oh that we would do ſo? Then ſhould we Reſt in the day of trouble. When <hi>Noah</hi> fore-ſaw the Deluge a coming, <hi>he prepared him an ark to the ſaving of both himſelf and Family,</hi> Heb. 11.7. Surely he s blind indeed, that does not ſee a Deluge coming upon the World, a Deluge of outward Troubles and Calamities: O why do we not <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60044:117"/>enark in God, by making him our Reſt: this God invites his People unto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Come, my People, enter thou into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy Doors about thee; hide thy ſelf, as it were, for a little moment, until theindignation be overpaſt: for, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity:</hi> What is it for God's People to enter into their Chambers, &amp; hide themſelves, but to retire more into him, live at Reſt and in Communion with him, to put themſelves under his protection, and the like? 'tis for them to retire from the World, and worldly Concernes, and to make him all, living and reſting wholly in him, and upon him. O let this, <hi>viz.</hi> the reſtleſneſs of the World you live in draw your Souls into an holy <hi>reſt</hi> in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider what enemies you are to your own Souls by not living at Reſt in God. <hi>He that ſinneth,</hi> ('tis ſaid)
<hi>wrongeth his own Soul;</hi> he that lives not at Reſt in God, greatly ſinneth, and thereby greatly wrongeth his own Soul. On the one hand, you hereby deprive your Souls of much Good; and on the other hand, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Souls to much Evil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby you deprive your Souls of much Good, yea of much of the beſt Good. <hi>Solomon</hi> found this in experience, and tells us that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Reſt and Happineſs in the Creature, and not in God, he did thereby <hi>bereave his Soul of Good,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.8. and what Good? Verily the <pb n="211" facs="tcp:60044:117"/>beſt Good, the Good of Grace, of Holineſs, of Communion with God, of the Comforts of his Spirit, and the like: and Oh how much of this Good do you bereave your Souls of dayly? This is that which hath bereaved you of much Grace, much Love, much Spiritual Comfort, many Imbraces in the Armes and Boſome of Chriſt's Love: This, (namely, our purſueing Reſt from the Creature, and not living at Reſt in God) is that which hath made us ſo lean, ſo dead, ſo dry, ſo barren in our Spirits, as we are. O my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, while we have been off our Reſt in God, and have taken up in other things, what have we been doing, but feeding upon Husks and Swill, when we might have eaten Bread, and drunk Wine in the Fathers Kingdom? what have we been doing, but following after lying vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the forſaking of our own mercies? Oh, did you know how ſweet a Life it is to be at Reſt in God, you would then know what Good you have bereaved your Souls of, by not living at Reſt in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby you expoſe your Souls to much evil. I remember a ſaying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In hoc peccabam, quod non in Deo, ſed in creaturis ejus, me atque caeteras volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates quaerebam, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ita irruebam in dolores, confuſiones &amp; errores animae.

                  <hi>In this I ſinned</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that, I ſought my Happineſs not in God, but in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo I ruſht upon all manner of Dolours, Confuſions, and Errors of <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60044:118"/>Soul:</hi> and have not we done So? O the wounds the Confuſions, the Errors of Soul, which we have expoſed our ſelves unto, while we have been off our Reſt in God! Sin and Satan have made great waſte and deſolation upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and 'tis what expoſes us to nothing but ſorrows, ſnares, and Death: and as we would not wrong our Souls, let us retire to, and live at Reſt in God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider that your living at Reſt in God here, will be a clear and unqueſtionable evidence to you, that you ſhall live at Reſt in God, and with God, for ever. O how ſweet is it to have any one clear evidence of living at Reſt in God, and with God, in Heaven? and what would ſome of our Souls at ſome times give for ſuch a bleſſing? yea, how ſweet is a ſmall glimpſe of Hope, a ſecret whiſper, an inward hint or intimation of ſuch a thing from the Spirit of God in our Souls? O, live at Reſt in God here, and this will be a broad evidence of it to you, and truly, unleſs you do live at Reſt in him here, I know not, however you will make it out to your Souls, that you ſhall live at Reſt in him, and with him in the other World. In ſhort, my Beloved, if we do indeed deſire to live at Reſt with God for ever in Heaven, why ſhould we not deſire to live at Reſt in God here? Sure I am, the thing is the ſame, and we ſhould deſire the one as well as the other, and the one <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60044:118"/>as the evidence of the other. O come, come, and be prevailed with by theſe things, one and all to take up the Reſt of your Souls purely and ſolely in God!</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> Several plain and proper Directions to Souls, how to attain unto this Life of a Rest in God. With a Concluſion of the whole Matter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO live at Reſt in God, that is a ſweet, a bleſſed Life indeed; but how may we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it? Our Souls would be at it, but how may we come up hereunto? a few Directions in that caſe, and I'le cloſe all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would you indeed live at Reſt in God? Then deſpair of ever finding Reſt any where but in him alone. As long as we have any hopes of a Reſt any where elſe, we will not ſo purely take up our Reſt in God, as we ſhould; for woe and alas for us! our <hi>heart is bent to back-ſlideing from him,</hi> Hoſ. 11.7. We are carnal, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and are addicted to carnal and ſenſual things: as ever therefore you would live at Reſt in God, utterly deſpair in your ſelves of ever finding Reſt, yea, any thing of Reſt any where <pb n="214" facs="tcp:60044:119"/>elſe: the more we are driven out of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, out of all our falſe Reſts and Repoſes, the nearer we are to an holy Reſt and Repoſe in God: it has been ſufficiently evidenced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that there is no true Reſt for a Soul but in God alone, and you have both ſeen and heard it; but, my Beloved, 'tis one thing to hear this by the hearing of the ear, and another thing for the Soul to come under the ſenſe and power thereof, ſo as indeed to be dead in our hopes to all other things, and practically to deſpair of Reſt and Happineſs any where but in God alone. Whatever we pretend or profeſs, at leaſt the moſt of us, we ſtill think that there is ſome Reſt, ſome Happineſs, in ſomewhat elſe beſides God, and ſhort of God; elſe, what mean our eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after other things, our delights in them, when injoyed, our grief and ſorrow of heart, when loſt or wanting? what means the ſecret bent and byas of our heart to ſtand off from God and cleave to other things, and the like? But all this muſt be rooted out, firmly fixing this Foundation-principle in your Souls, that there is no Reſt for a Soul but in God alone, and accordingly never have a thought of looking elſewhere. And when at any time the heart would be going out to other things, check it with this conſideration, Reſt; for the Soul is to be found only in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would you indeed live at Reſt in God?
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60044:119"/>Then labour to know him much, and to know him in Chriſt. The more we know God, the more we ſhall love him; and the more we know and love him, the more ſhall we Reſt in him: <hi>They that know thy Name,</hi> (ſaies the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>will truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. they will Reſt in thee, depend on thee: one great reaſon, why we do not Reſt in God, is, becauſe we do not know him, at leaſt ſo know him, as to carry in us right notions and apprehenſions of him: labour therefore to know God more and better, labour to know him in Chriſt: God in Chriſt is moſt ſweet, moſt lovely, moſt raviſhing and ſolacing to Souls; God in Chriſt is a God of Love, yea, a God that is Love: <hi>God is Love</hi> (ſayes St. <hi>John</hi>) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. God in Chriſt, is a God of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. and Oh how ſweet is God thus known! God in Chriſt, is <hi>the Father of Mercies, the God of all Grace, and Comfort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. he is a full, free, open Fountain of all Spiritual Good. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. we read of
<hi>the light of the Knowledg of the Glory of God ſhining forth in the face of Chriſt:</hi> and indeed the Light, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, his Beauty, Sweetneſs, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ſhines forth no where ſo brightly and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly, as in Jeſus Chriſt. To know God or to look on him out of Chriſt, is what rather fills the Soul with trouble, than brings it to Reſt <pb n="216" facs="tcp:60044:120"/>in him. <hi>I remembred God, and was troubled</hi> (ſaid he) Pſal. 77.3. God out of Chriſt is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an angry Judge, a conſuming fire, one that is ready to damn and deſtroy the Soul; but in Chriſt, he is a God of Pardon, a God of Salvation to all that come by Chriſt to him; Hence ſome of the Saints have profeſt that they durſt not think of God out of Chriſt: and (you know) what <hi>Luther's</hi> thoughts were by that out-cry of his; <hi>I'le have nothing to do with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute God.</hi> O therefore labour to know God in Chriſt more; being known in him, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſweet to Souls, and they cannot but find that ſweetneſs in him, that ſhall draw and allure them to make him their Reſt, and All for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Would you indeed live at Reſt, in God? Then labour to get your Covenant-intereſt in, and Relation to God cleared up to you. The clearer your intereſt in God is to you, the fuller and more conſtant will your Reſt in him be; and indeed you will never ſo fully and ſweetly acquieſce in God, as you ſhould, until you come to ſome good ſenſe of your Intereſt in him, and Relation to him in Chriſt and the Covenant; In 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>David encouraged his heart in the Lord [his God];</hi> he ſaw God to be [his God], and ſeeing him to be ſo, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelf in him, he ſat down ſatisfied and at Reſt in him; and that in the midſt of <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60044:120"/>many, great, and ſore Diſtreſſes, as you may there ſee: Had he not ſeen him to be his, I queſtion whether he would have been able to ſit down at Reſt in him, as he did, eſpecially in ſo great a ſtorm? So the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi>
3.24. <hi>the Lord is my Portion ſaith my Soul, therefore I'le hope in him:</hi> Seeing God to be her Portion, She could hope, truſt, Reſt in him, and that in a caſe of great calamity and diſtreſs. I will not ſay a Soul cannot Reſt in God without a ſenſe of his intereſt in him; no,
'tis the Souls duty to Reſt in God however things go with him; though he be
<hi>in the dark,</hi> though God has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from the Soul, yet
<hi>the Soul ſhould truſt in the Name of the Lord, and Reſt himſelf in his God,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. ſtill there is that in God, that is a full and proper matter or ground of Reſt in him; for he is, as High, as Holy, as Wiſe, as Good, as All-ſufficient, as ever he was; and indeed we ſhould learn to believe in the dark: But though this be ſo, yet ſtill I ſay, the clearer your Intereſt in God is to you, the more fully and ſweetly will you Reſt in him. The ſenſe of an intereſt in God, is what is moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to reduce a Soul to its Reſt in God, when through temptation it has been carryed off from it: ſo we find, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. (which may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opened afterwards); as ever therefore you would live purely and entirely at Reſt in God, get your intereſt in him, as your God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60044:121"/>cleared up to you; firſt chuſe him for your God and Portion; and do it every day, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Reſt, till you can ſay, <hi>Lord, whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee: my Heart and my Fleſh fail, but God is the ſtrength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever;</hi> Pſal. 73.25, 26. Then Pray hard for the ſealings and witneſs of the Spirit; beg the Lord, with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to ſay unto thy Soul, <hi>I am thy Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Would you indeed live at Reſt in God? Then meditate and contemplate him much, dwell much in the view of his glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Perfections: Deep and frequent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of God and his Excellencies, does mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly endear God unto Souls, and withal brings them into an acquaintance with thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying delights that are to be found in him, and ſo to a Reſt in him. <hi>My Soul,</hi> (ſaies <hi>David</hi>)
<hi>ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips, when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night-watches,</hi> Pſal. 63.5, 6. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. he is even raviſhed with the ſenſe and incomes of God's Love to him: <hi>Thy loving-kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Life, my lips ſhall praiſe thee;</hi> and here he ſpeaks of Satisfaction, the ſweeteſt Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and all that which came in a way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditation; and again, <hi>my meditation of thee ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104.34. Holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60044:121"/>of God produces many ſweet experiences of God in the Soul, experiences of his Grace, of his Love, of his Sweetneſs, of the Bleſſedneſs of Communion with him, and the like; and theſe experiences iſſue in the Soul's Reſt in him: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y new experience of God, draws the heart fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into God, and makes it center more in him: every taſte, every ſight of God, every new ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation of his Glory before the Soul, (of which in the holy meditation of God the Saints have not a few) weans and works the heart off from carnal, ſenſible things, and makes him to cleave more cloſly and entirely to God, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in about him, as his All. O, be much in the meditation of God: 'tis not enough for us to know him, and to know him in Chriſt; no, nor to know him as ours, as our God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but we muſt ſtudy him, we muſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what a God he is, and ſingle him out, now under one, and then under another Notion or Conſideration, to meditate upon, begging God to help us in our meditetions of him. The moſt know, and enjoy little of God; becauſe they meditate him ſo little, they are little in holy meditation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Would you indeed be at Reſt in God? Then improve all your experiences of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vanity, for the carrying of your Souls more into God, as your Reſt and Centre. Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did ſo, and 'tis indeed a great piece of a <pb n="221" facs="tcp:60044:122"/>Chriſtians skill.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.7. <hi>And now Lord</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>what wait I for? my hope is in thee:</hi> If you veiw, either the foregoing or following part of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> you will find that <hi>David</hi> was under great experiences of the Creatures vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he ſaw the vanity of worldly Injoyments they are all <hi>but a vain ſhew;</hi> he ſaw his own vanity, he ſaw the vanity of others, he found every one, and every thing, nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and what is the iſſue? What uſe does he make of it? this, he gathers in more to God, as his only Reſt and Happineſs; <hi>now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee,</hi> q.d. Now I have done with the Creatures, I ſee what they are, and what all perſons and things are, and I have done with all, thou thy ſelf only, O Lord, art my Reſt, my Happineſs, my All. Thus when at any time you meet with freſh experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Creatures vanity, improve them for the carrying of your Souls more into God, as your Reſt. You ſcarce live that day wherein you do not meet with new experiences of the Creatures vanity, this is loſt, and that is imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to you; now you meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then with ſorrows, wounds, and ſnares; and that, where, it may be, you expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your chief Comfort and Satisfaction; now in all ſuch caſes, what ſhould we do? retire the more into God, as our Reſt and Happineſs: ſay with <hi>the Pſalmiſt, Now Lord, what wait I for?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60044:122"/>My hope is in thee;</hi> I have done with the ſtreams, I'le cleave only to thee, the Fountain; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ever ſerve me thus, they leave me under ſorrows, ſnares, and diſappointments, thou Lord ſhalt be all in all to me, thou art my only Reſt for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Would you indeed live at Reſt in God? Then pray for much ſpirituality of Heart, much ſuitedneſs of Spirit to God and Chriſt. The more Spiritual you are, the more are you ſuited to the bleſſed God, and the more you are ſuited to God, the more fully and genuinly will your Souls Reſt in him. I ſuppoſe you to have a new heart, (for I ſpeak unto you as to Saints) the old heart to be ſure will never Reſt in God, the old heart is wholly avetſe from God, and at enmity with him, it hates him, 'tis wholly carnal, ſenſual, and unclean, and delights only in things ſuitable to it ſelf; Let all therefore that would Reſt in God, firſt, get a new heart, ſuch as God promiſes in his Covenant,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. and having gotten a new heart, pray for much ſpirituality of heart and affection. Alas! alas! we are <hi>carnal,</hi> (as
<hi>Paul</hi> charged his <hi>Corinthians</hi>) and being carnal, we lean to, and hanker after carnal things, and till we get more ſpirituality, we ſhall not Reſt ſo fully in God, as we ſhould; therefore pray unto God hard for more of this, pray for more of his Spirit, to act and influence you; and not only ſo, <pb n="223" facs="tcp:60044:123"/>but to change you more and more into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life and Image.</p>
               <p>To conclude all; Live at Reſt all that even you can in God here, but withal, look, and long and haſten to that Reſt which remaines for Saints with God in the other World: True Reſt in God here is ſweet; but we ſhall never be fully and perfectly happy, till we enter that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſt: that indeed carryes a compleat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinſs in it: O, to be wholly ſwallowed up in the Divine Will, the Divine Life, the Divine Fulneſs, the Ocean of Divine Love, to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faculty, and every affection perfectly ſuited to God, and filled with God, this cannot but be perfect Reſt and Happineſs; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what an enlargement there will be of all the Faculties, and how much of God they will then take in: But till we reach this Reſt, we cannot have any compleat Reſt; therefore breath and ſuſpire after the future Reſt, keep your eye much there, and let your eye affect your heart, look and love, love and long, long and haſten to that ſweet, that holy, that heavenly, that inviolable, that unchangeable, and eternal Reſt, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for Saints in God, and with God, in the other World, crying out, both in your Spirits and lives; <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Amen.</p>
